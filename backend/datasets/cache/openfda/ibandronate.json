Quarterly Intravenous Injection \u2013 In a 1-year, double-blind, multicenter study comparing Ibandronate Sodium Injection administered intravenously as 3 mg every 3 months to Ibandronate Sodium 2.5 mg daily oral tablet in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis, the overall safety and tolerability profiles of the two dosing regimens were similar. The incidence of serious adverse reactions was 8.0% in the Ibandronate Sodium 2.5 mg daily group and 7.5% in the Ibandronate Sodium Injection 3 mg once every 3 months group. The percentage of patients who withdrew from treatment due to adverse reactions was approximately 6.7% in the Ibandronate Sodium 2.5 mg daily group and 8.5% in the Ibandronate Sodium Injection 3 mg every 3 months group. Table 1 lists the adverse reactions reported in greater than 2% of patients. Table 1 Adverse Reactions With an Incidence of at Least 2% in Patients Treated with Ibandronate Sodium Injection (3 mg once every 3 months) or Ibandronate Sodium Daily Oral Tablet (2.5 mg) Body System/Adverse Reaction Ibandronate Sodium 2.5 mg Daily (Oral) % (n=465) Ibandronate Sodium 3 mg every 3 months (Intravenous) % (n=469) Infections and Infestations Influenza 8 5 Nasopharyngitis 6 3 Cystitis 3 2 Gastroenteritis 3 2 Urinary Tract Infection 3 3 Bronchitis 3 2 Upper Respiratory Tract Infection 3 1 Gastrointestinal Disorders Abdominal Pain Combination of abdominal pain and abdominal pain upper 6 5 Dyspepsia 4 4 Nausea 4 2 Constipation 4 3 Diarrhea 2 3 Gastritis 2 2 Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders Arthralgia 9 10 Back Pain 8 7 Localized Osteoarthritis 2 2 Pain in Extremity 2 3 Myalgia 1 3 Nervous System Disorders Dizziness 3 2 Headache 3 4 Psychiatric Disorders Insomnia 3 1 Depression 2 1 General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions Influenza-like Illness Combination of influenza-like illness and acute phase reaction 1 5 Fatigue 1 3 Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Rash Combination of rash, rash pruritic, rash macular, dermatitis, dermatitis allergic, exanthema, erythema, rash papular, rash generalized, dermatitis medicamentosa, rash erythematous 3 2 Acute Phase Reaction-like Events Symptoms consistent with acute phase reaction (APR) have been reported with intravenous bisphosphonate use. The overall incidence of patients with APR-like events was higher in the intravenous treatment group (4% in the Ibandronate Sodium 2.5 mg daily oral tablet group vs. 10% in the Ibandronate Sodium Injection 3 mg once every 3 months group). These incidence rates are based upon reporting of any of 33 potential APR-like symptoms within 3 days of an intravenous dose and lasting 7 days or less. In most cases, no specific treatment was required and the symptoms subsided within 24 to 48 hours. Injection Site Reactions Local reactions at the injection site, such as redness or swelling, were observed at a higher incidence in patients treated with Ibandronate Sodium Injection 3 mg every 3 months (1.7%; 8/469) than in patients treated with placebo injections (0.2%; 1/465). In most cases, the reaction was of mild to moderate severity. Daily Oral Tablet - The safety of Ibandronate Sodium 2.5 mg once daily in the treatment and prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis was assessed in 3577 patients aged 41 \u2013 82 years. The duration of the trials was 2 to 3 years, with 1134 patients exposed to placebo and 1140 exposed to Ibandronate Sodium 2.5 mg. Patients with pre-existing gastrointestinal disease and concomitant use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, proton pump inhibitors and H2 antagonists were included in these clinical trials. All patients received 500 mg calcium plus 400 international units vitamin D supplementation daily. The incidence of all-cause mortality was 1% in the placebo group and 1.2% in the Ibandronate Sodium 2.5 mg daily group. The incidence of serious adverse reactions was 20% in the placebo group and 23% in the Ibandronate Sodium 2.5 mg daily oral tablet group. The percentage of patients who withdrew from treatment due to adverse reactions was approximately 17% in both the placebo group and the Ibandronate Sodium 2.5 mg daily oral tablet group. Table 2 lists adverse reactions from the Treatment and Prevention Studies reported in greater than or equal to 2% of patients and in more patients treated with Ibandronate Sodium 2.5 mg daily oral tablet than patients treated with placebo.

Musculoskeletal Adverse Reactions The incidence of selected musculoskeletal adverse reactions in the placebo and Ibandronate Sodium 2.5 mg daily groups were: back pain (12% vs. 14%), arthralgia (14% vs. 14%) and myalgia (5% vs. 6%). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Ibandronate Sodium Injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity : Allergic reactions including anaphylaxis with fatalities, angioedema, asthma exacerbation, bronchospasm, rash, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, and dermatitis bullous [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Hypocalcemia : Hypocalcemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Renal Toxicity : Acute renal failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Osteonecrosis of the Jaw : Osteonecrosis of the jaw and other oro-facial sites, including the external auditory canal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . Musculoskeletal Pain : Bone, joint, or muscle pain (musculoskeletal pain), described as severe or incapacitating [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Atypical Femoral Shaft Fracture : Atypical, low-energy, or low-trauma fractures of the femoral shaft [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. Eye Inflammation : Iritis and uveitis. In some cases with other bisphosphonates, these events did not resolve until the bisphosphonate was discontinued."
