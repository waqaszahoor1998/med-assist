    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors or P-gp inhibitors: Adjust dosage of VENCLEXTA. ( 2.6 , 7.1 ) Strong or moderate CYP3A inducers: Avoid co-administration. ( 7.1 ) P-gp substrates: Take at least 6 hours before VENCLEXTA. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on VENCLEXTA Strong or Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors or P-gp Inhibitors Concomitant use with a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor or a P-gp inhibitor increases venetoclax C max and AUC 0-INF [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , which may increase VENCLEXTA toxicities, including the risk of TLS [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Concomitant use with a strong CYP3A inhibitor at initiation and during the ramp-up phase in patients with CLL/SLL is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . In patients with CLL/SLL taking a steady daily dosage (after ramp-up phase), consider alternative medications or adjust VENCLEXTA dosage and monitor more frequently for adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 , 2.6 )] . In patients with AML, adjust VENCLEXTA dosage and monitor more frequently for adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 , 2.6 )] . Resume the VENCLEXTA dosage that was used prior to concomitant use with a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor or a P-gp inhibitor 2 to 3 days after discontinuation of the inhibitor [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 , 2.6 )] . Avoid grapefruit products, Seville oranges, and starfruit during treatment with VENCLEXTA, as they contain inhibitors of CYP3A. Strong or Moderate CYP3A Inducers Concomitant use with a strong CYP3A inducer decreases venetoclax C max and AUC 0-INF [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , which may decrease VENCLEXTA efficacy. Avoid concomitant use of VENCLEXTA with strong CYP3A inducers or moderate CYP3A inducers. 7.2 Effect of VENCLEXTA on Other Drugs Warfarin Concomitant use of VENCLEXTA increases warfarin C max and AUC 0-INF [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , which may increase the risk of bleeding. Monitor international normalized ratio (INR) more frequently in patients using warfarin concomitantly with VENCLEXTA. P-gp Substrates Concomitant use of VENCLEXTA increases C max and AUC 0-INF of P-gp substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , which may increase toxicities of these substrates. Avoid concomitant use of VENCLEXTA with a P-gp substrate. If a concomitant use is unavoidable, separate dosing of the P-gp substrate at least 6 hours before VENCLEXTA."

    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Tumor Lysis Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Neutropenia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Infections [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] In CLL/SLL, the most common adverse reactions (\u226520%) for VENCLEXTA when given in combination with obinutuzumab or rituximab or as monotherapy are neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, diarrhea, nausea, upper respiratory tract infection, cough, musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and edema. ( 6.1 ) In AML, the most common adverse reactions (\u226530%) in combination with azacitidine or decitabine or low-dose cytarabine are nausea, diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, constipation, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, fatigue, vomiting, edema, pyrexia, pneumonia, dyspnea, hemorrhage, anemia, rash, abdominal pain, sepsis, musculoskeletal pain, dizziness, cough, oropharyngeal pain, and hypotension. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact AbbVie Inc. at 1-800-633-9110 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely variable conditions, adverse event rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates of clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In CLL/SLL, the safety population reflects exposure to VENCLEXTA as monotherapy in patients in M13-982, M14-032, and M12-175 and in combination with obinutuzumab or rituximab in patients in CLL14 and MURANO. In this CLL/SLL safety population, the most common adverse reactions (\u226520%) for VENCLEXTA were neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, diarrhea, nausea, upper respiratory tract infection, cough, musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and edema. In AML, the safety population reflects exposure to VENCLEXTA in combination with decitabine, azacitidine, or low-dose cytarabine in patients in M14-358, VIALE-A, and VIALE-C. In this safety population, the most common adverse reactions (\u226530% in any trial) were nausea, diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, constipation, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, fatigue, vomiting, edema, pyrexia, pneumonia, dyspnea, hemorrhage, anemia, rash, abdominal pain, sepsis, musculoskeletal pain, dizziness, cough, oropharyngeal pain, and hypotension. Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma VENCLEXTA in Combination with Obinutuzumab The safety of VENCLEXTA in combination with obinutuzumab (VEN+G) (N=212) versus obinutuzumab in combination with chlorambucil (GClb) (N=214) was evaluated in CLL14, a randomized, open-label, actively controlled trial in patients with previously untreated CLL [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . Patients randomized to the VEN+G arm were treated with VENCLEXTA and obinutuzumab in combination for six cycles, then with VENCLEXTA as monotherapy for an additional six cycles. Patients initiated the first dose of the 5-week ramp-up for VENCLEXTA on Day 22 of Cycle 1 and once completed, continued VENCLEXTA 400 mg orally once daily for a total of 12 cycles. The trial required a total Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS) >6 or CLcr <70 mL/min, hepatic transaminases and total bilirubin \u22642 times upper limit of normal and excluded patients with any individual organ/system impairment score of 4 by CIRS except eye, ear, nose, and throat organ system. The median duration of exposure to VENCLEXTA was 10.5 months (range: 0 to 13.5 months) and the median number of cycles of obinutuzumab was 6 in the VEN+G arm. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 49% of patients in the VEN+G arm, most often due to febrile neutropenia and pneumonia (5% each). Fatal adverse reactions that occurred in the absence of disease progression and with onset within 28 days of the last study treatment were reported in 2% (4/212) of patients, most often from infection. In the VEN+G arm, adverse reactions led to treatment discontinuation in 16% of patients, dose reduction in 21%, and dose interruption in 74%. Neutropenia led to discontinuation of VENCLEXTA in 2% of patients, dose reduction in 13%, and dose interruption in 41%. Table 9 presents adverse reactions identified in CLL14. Table 9.

VENCLEXTA in Combination with Rituximab The safety of VENCLEXTA in combination with rituximab (VEN+R) (N=194) versus bendamustine in combination with rituximab (B+R) (N=188) was evaluated in MURANO [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . Patients randomized to VEN+R completed the scheduled ramp-up (5 weeks) and received VENCLEXTA 400 mg once daily, in combination with rituximab for 6 cycles followed by VENCLEXTA monotherapy, for a total of 24 months after ramp-up. At the time of analysis, the median duration of exposure to VENCLEXTA was 22 months and the median number of cycles of rituximab was 6 in the VEN+R arm. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 46% of patients in the VEN+R arm, with most frequent (\u22655%) being pneumonia (9%). Fatal adverse reactions that occurred in the absence of disease progression and within 30 days of the last VENCLEXTA treatment and/or 90 days of last rituximab were reported in 2% (4/194) of patients. In the VEN+R arm, adverse reactions led to treatment discontinuation in 16% of patients, dose reduction in 15%, and dose interruption in 71%. Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia each led to discontinuation of VENCLEXTA in 3% of patients. Neutropenia led to dose interruption of VENCLEXTA in 46% of patients.

VENCLEXTA as Monotherapy The safety of VENCLEXTA was evaluated in pooled data from three single-arm trials (M13-982, M14-032, and M12-175). Patients received VENCLEXTA 400 mg orally once daily after completing the ramp-up phase (N=352). The median duration of treatment with VENCLEXTA at the time of data analysis was 14.5 months (range: 0 to 50 months). Fifty-two percent of patients received VENCLEXTA for more than 60 weeks. In the pooled dataset, the median age was 66 years (range: 28 to 85 years), 93% were White, and 68% were male. The median number of prior therapies was 3 (range: 0 to 15). Serious adverse reactions were reported in 52% of patients, with the most frequent (\u22655%) being pneumonia (9%), febrile neutropenia (5%), and sepsis (5%). Fatal adverse reactions that occurred in the absence of disease progression and within 30 days of venetoclax treatment were reported in 2% of patients in the VENCLEXTA monotherapy studies, most often (2 patients) from septic shock. Adverse reactions led to treatment discontinuation in 9% of patients, dose reduction in 13%, and dose interruption in 36%. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to drug discontinuation were thrombocytopenia and autoimmune hemolytic anemia. The most frequent adverse reaction (\u22655%) leading to dose reductions or interruptions was neutropenia (8%). Table 13 presents adverse reactions identified in these trials. Table 13.

Important Adverse Reactions in CLL/SLL Tumor Lysis Syndrome Tumor lysis syndrome is an important identified risk when initiating VENCLEXTA. CLL14 The incidence of TLS was 1% (3/212) in patients treated with VEN+G [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . All three events of TLS resolved and did not lead to withdrawal from the trial. Obinutuzumab administration was delayed in two cases in response to the TLS events. MURANO The incidence of TLS was 3% (6/194) in patients treated with VEN+R. After 77/389 patients were enrolled in the trial, the protocol was amended to incorporate the current TLS prophylaxis and monitoring measures described in sections 2.2 and 2.4 [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.4 )] . All events of TLS occurred during the VENCLEXTA ramp-up period and were resolved within two days. All six patients completed the ramp-up and reached the recommended daily dose of 400 mg of VENCLEXTA. No clinical TLS was observed in patients who followed the current 5-week ramp-up schedule and TLS prophylaxis and monitoring measures [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.4 )] . Rates of laboratory abnormalities relevant to TLS for patients treated with VEN+R are presented in Table 12 . Monotherapy Studies (M13-982 and M14-032) In 168 patients with CLL treated according to recommendations described in sections 2.1 and 2.2, the rate of TLS was 2% [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.4 )] . All events either met laboratory TLS criteria (laboratory abnormalities that met \u22652 of the following within 24 hours of each other: potassium >6 mmol/L, uric acid >476 \u00b5mol/L, calcium <1.75 mmol/L, or phosphorus >1.5 mmol/L), or were reported as TLS events. The events occurred in patients who had a lymph node(s) \u22655 cm and/or absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) \u226525 x 10 9 /L. All events resolved within 5 days. No TLS with clinical consequences such as acute renal failure, cardiac arrhythmias, or sudden death and/or seizures was observed in these patients. All patients had CLcr \u226550 mL/min. Laboratory abnormalities relevant to TLS were hyperkalemia (17% all Grades, 1% Grade \u22653), hyperphosphatemia (14% all Grades, 2% Grade \u22653), hypocalcemia (16% all Grades, 2% Grade \u22653), and hyperuricemia (10% all Grades, <1% Grade \u22653). In the initial Phase 1 dose-finding trials, which had shorter (2-3 week) ramp-up phase and higher starting doses, the incidence of TLS was 13% (10/77; 5 laboratory TLS, 5 clinical TLS), including 2 fatal events and 3 events of acute renal failure, 1 requiring dialysis. After this experience, TLS risk assessment, dosing regimen, TLS prophylaxis and monitoring measures were revised [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.4 )] . Acute Myeloid Leukemia VENCLEXTA in Combination with Azacitidine The safety of VENCLEXTA in combination with azacitidine (VEN+AZA) (N=283) versus placebo in combination with azacitidine (PBO+AZA) (N=144) was evaluated in VIALE-A, a double-blind, randomized trial, in patients with newly diagnosed AML [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . At baseline, patients were \u226575 years of age or had comorbidities that precluded the use of intensive induction chemotherapy based on at least one of the following criteria: baseline ECOG performance status of 2-3, severe cardiac or pulmonary comorbidity, moderate hepatic impairment, CLcr <45 mL/min, or other comorbidity. Patients were randomized to receive VENCLEXTA 400 mg orally once daily after completion of the ramp-up phase in combination with azacitidine (75 mg/m 2 either intravenously or subcutaneously on Days 1-7 of each 28-day cycle) or placebo in combination with azacitidine. Among patients who received VEN+AZA, the median duration of exposure to VENCLEXTA was 7.6 months (range: <0.1 to 30.7 months). Serious adverse reactions were reported in 83% of patients who received VEN+AZA, with the most frequent (\u22655%) being febrile neutropenia (30%), pneumonia (22%), sepsis (excluding fungal; 19%), and hemorrhage (6%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 23% of patients who received VEN+AZA, with the most frequent (\u22652%) being pneumonia (4%), sepsis (excluding fungal; 3%), and hemorrhage (2%). Adverse reactions led to permanent discontinuation of VENCLEXTA in 24% of patients, dose reductions in 2%, and dose interruptions in 72%. Adverse reactions which led to discontinuation of VENCLEXTA in \u22652% of patients were sepsis (excluding fungal; 3%) and pneumonia (2%). The most frequent adverse reaction leading to dose reduction was pneumonia (0.7%). Adverse reactions which required a dose interruption in \u22655% of patients included febrile neutropenia (20%), neutropenia (20%), pneumonia (14%), sepsis (excluding fungal; 11%), and thrombocytopenia (10%). Among patients who achieved bone marrow clearance of leukemia, 53% underwent dose interruptions for absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <500/microliter.

VENCLEXTA in Combination with Azacitidine or Decitabine The safety of VENCLEXTA in combination with azacitidine (N=67) or decitabine (N=13) was evaluated in M14-358, a non-randomized trial of patients with newly diagnosed AML. At baseline, patients were \u226575 years of age, or had comorbidities that precluded the use of intensive induction chemotherapy based on at least one of the following criteria: baseline ECOG performance status of 2-3, severe cardiac or pulmonary comorbidity, moderate hepatic impairment, CLcr <45 mL/min, or other comorbidity [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . Patients received VENCLEXTA 400 mg orally once daily after completion of the ramp-up phase in combination with azacitidine (75 mg/m 2 either intravenously or subcutaneously on Days 1-7 of each 28-day cycle) or decitabine (20 mg/m 2 intravenously on Days 1-5 of each 28-day cycle). Azacitidine The median duration of exposure to VENCLEXTA when administered in combination with azacitidine was 6.5 months (range: 0.1 to 38.1 months). The safety of VENCLEXTA in combination with azacitidine in this trial is consistent with that of VIALE-A. Decitabine The median duration of exposure to VENCLEXTA when administered in combination with decitabine was 8.4 months (range: 0.5 to 39 months). Serious adverse reactions were reported in 85% of patients who received VENCLEXTA with decitabine, the most frequent (\u226510%) being sepsis (excluding fungal; 46%), febrile neutropenia (38%), and pneumonia (31%). One (8%) fatal adverse reaction of bacteremia occurred within 30 days of starting treatment. Permanent discontinuation of VENCLEXTA due to adverse reactions occurred in 38% of patients. The most frequent adverse reaction leading to permanent discontinuation (\u22655%) was pneumonia (8%). Dosage reductions of VENCLEXTA due to adverse reactions occurred in 15% of patients.

VENCLEXTA in Combination with Low-Dose Cytarabine VIALE-C The safety of VENCLEXTA in combination with low-dose cytarabine (VEN+LDAC) (N=142) versus placebo with low-dose cytarabine (PBO+LDAC) (N=68) was evaluated in VIALE-C, a double-blind randomized trial in patients with newly diagnosed AML. At baseline, patients were \u226575 years of age, or had comorbidities that precluded the use of intensive induction chemotherapy based on at least one of the following criteria: baseline ECOG performance status of 2-3, severe cardiac or pulmonary comorbidity, moderate hepatic impairment, CLcr <45 mL/min, or other comorbidity [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . Patients were randomized to receive VENCLEXTA 600 mg orally once daily after completion of a 4-day ramp-up phase in combination with low-dose cytarabine (20 mg/m 2 subcutaneously once daily on Days 1-10 of each 28-day cycle) or placebo in combination with low-dose cytarabine. Among patients who received VEN+LDAC, the median duration of exposure to VENCLEXTA was 3.9 months (range: <0.1 to 17.1 months). Serious adverse reactions were reported in 65% of patients who received VEN+LDAC, with the most frequent (\u226510%) being pneumonia (17%), febrile neutropenia (16%), and sepsis (excluding fungal; 12%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 23% of patients who received VEN+LDAC, with the most frequent (\u22655%) being pneumonia (6%) and sepsis (excluding fungal; 7%). Adverse reactions led to permanent discontinuation of VENCLEXTA in 25% of patients, dose reductions in 9%, and dose interruptions in 63%. The most frequent adverse reaction (>2%) which resulted in permanent discontinuation of VENCLEXTA was pneumonia (6%). Adverse reactions which required a dose reduction in \u22651% of patients were pneumonia (1%) and thrombocytopenia (1%), and the adverse reactions which required a dose interruption in \u22655% of patients included neutropenia (20%), thrombocytopenia (15%), pneumonia (8%), febrile neutropenia (6%), and sepsis (excluding fungal; 6%). Among patients who achieved bone marrow clearance of leukemia, 32% underwent dose interruptions for ANC <500/microliter. Table 17 presents adverse reactions identified in VIALE-C. Table 17.

Do not chew, crush, or break tablets. ( 2.8 ) Provide prophylaxis for tumor lysis syndrome. ( 2.1 , 2.4 ) 2.1 Important Safety Information Assess patient-specific factors for level of risk of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) and provide prophylactic hydration and anti-hyperuricemics to patients prior to first dose of VENCLEXTA to reduce risk of TLS [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. 2.2 Recommended Dosage for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma VENCLEXTA dosing begins with a 5-week ramp-up. The 5-week ramp-up dosing schedule is designed to gradually reduce tumor burden (debulk) and decrease the risk of TLS. VENCLEXTA 5-week Dose Ramp-Up Schedule Administer VENCLEXTA according to the 5-week ramp-up dosing schedule to the recommended dosage of 400 mg orally once daily as shown in Table 1 . Table 1. Dosing Schedule for 5-Week Ramp-up Phase for Patients with CLL/SLL VENCLEXTA Oral Daily Dose Week 1 20 mg Week 2 50 mg Week 3 100 mg Week 4 200 mg Week 5 and beyond 400 mg The CLL/SLL Starting Pack provides the first 4 weeks of VENCLEXTA according to the ramp-up schedule [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling ( 16 )] . In Combination with Obinutuzumab Start obinutuzumab administration at 100 mg on Cycle 1 Day 1, followed by 900 mg on Cycle 1 Day 2. Administer 1000 mg on Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 1 and on Day 1 of each subsequent 28-day cycle for a total of 6 cycles. Refer to the obinutuzumab prescribing information for additional dosing information. On Cycle 1 Day 22, start VENCLEXTA according to the 5-week ramp-up dosing schedule (see Table 1 ). After completing the ramp-up phase on Cycle 2 Day 28, continue VENCLEXTA at a dose of 400 mg orally once daily from Cycle 3 Day 1 until the last day of Cycle 12. In Combination with Rituximab Start rituximab administration after the patient has completed the 5-week ramp-up dosing schedule for VENCLEXTA (see Table 1 ) and has received VENCLEXTA at the recommended dosage of 400 mg orally once daily for 7 days. Administer rituximab on Day 1 of each 28-day cycle for 6 cycles, at a dose of 375 mg/m 2 intravenously for Cycle 1 and 500 mg/m 2 intravenously for Cycles 2-6. Continue VENCLEXTA 400 mg orally once daily for 24 months from Cycle 1 Day 1 of rituximab. Refer to the rituximab prescribing information for additional dosing information. Monotherapy The recommended dosage of VENCLEXTA is 400 mg once daily after completion of the 5-week ramp-up dosing schedule (see Table 1 ). Continue VENCLEXTA until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 2.3 Recommended Dosage for Acute Myeloid Leukemia The recommended dosage and ramp-up of VENCLEXTA depends upon the combination agent. Follow the dosing schedule, including the 3-day or 4-day dose ramp-up, as shown in Table 2.

Refer to Clinical Studies ( 14.2 ) and Prescribing Information for azacitidine, decitabine, or cytarabine for additional dosing information. 2.4 Risk Assessment and Prophylaxis for Tumor Lysis Syndrome Patients treated with VENCLEXTA may develop tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). Refer to the appropriate section below for specific details on management. Assess patient-specific factors for level of risk of TLS and provide prophylactic hydration and anti-hyperuricemics to patients prior to first dose of VENCLEXTA to reduce risk of TLS. Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma VENCLEXTA can cause rapid reduction in tumor and thus poses a risk for TLS in the initial 5-week ramp-up phase. Changes in blood chemistries consistent with TLS that require prompt management can occur as early as 6 to 8 hours following the first dose of VENCLEXTA and at each dose increase. TLS can also occur upon resumption of VENCLEXTA following a dosage interruption. See Table 4 and Table 5 for dose modifications of VENCLEXTA after interruption. The risk of TLS is a continuum based on multiple factors, particularly reduced renal function (creatinine clearance [CLcr] <80 mL/min) and tumor burden; splenomegaly may also increase the risk of TLS. Perform tumor burden assessments, including radiographic evaluation (e.g., CT scan), assess blood chemistry (potassium, uric acid, phosphorus, calcium, and creatinine) in all patients and correct pre-existing abnormalities prior to initiation of treatment with VENCLEXTA. The risk may decrease as tumor burden decreases [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . Table 3 below describes the recommended TLS prophylaxis and monitoring during VENCLEXTA treatment based on tumor burden determination from clinical trial data. Consider all patient comorbidities before final determination of prophylaxis and monitoring schedule. Reassess the risk of TLS when reinitiating VENCLEXTA after a dosage interruption lasting more than 1 week during the ramp-up phase, or more than 2 weeks after completion of ramp-up. Institute prophylaxis and monitoring as needed. Table 3.

Acute Myeloid Leukemia All patients should have white blood cell count less than 25 \u00d7 10 9 /L prior to initiation of VENCLEXTA. Cytoreduction prior to treatment may be required. Prior to first VENCLEXTA dose, provide all patients with prophylactic measures including adequate hydration and anti-hyperuricemic agents and continue during ramp-up phase. Assess blood chemistry (potassium, uric acid, phosphorus, calcium, and creatinine) and correct pre-existing abnormalities prior to initiation of treatment with VENCLEXTA. Monitor blood chemistries for TLS at pre-dose, 6 to 8 hours after each new dose during ramp-up, and 24 hours after reaching final dose. For patients with risk factors for TLS (e.g., circulating blasts, high burden of leukemia involvement in bone marrow, elevated pretreatment lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] levels, or reduced renal function), consider additional measures, including increased laboratory monitoring and reducing VENCLEXTA starting dose. 2.5 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma The recommended dosage modifications for VENCLEXTA for adverse reactions are provided in Table 4 and the recommended dose reductions for VENCLEXTA for adverse reactions are provided in Table 5. For patients having a dosage interruption lasting more than 1 week during the ramp-up phase, or more than 2 weeks after completion of ramp-up, reassess for risk of TLS to determine if reinitiation with a reduced dose is necessary (e.g., all or some levels of the dose ramp-up schedule) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.4 )].

Acute Myeloid Leukemia Monitor blood counts frequently through resolution of cytopenias. Dose modification and interruptions for cytopenias are dependent on remission status. Dose modifications of VENCLEXTA for adverse reactions are provided in Table 6. Table 6. Recommended VENCLEXTA Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions in AML Adverse Reaction Occurrence Dosage Modification Hematologic Adverse Reactions Grade 4 neutropenia with or without fever or infection; or Grade 4 thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Occurrence prior to achieving remission a In most instances, do not interrupt VENCLEXTA in combination with azacitidine, decitabine, or low-dose cytarabine due to cytopenias prior to achieving remission. First occurrence after achieving remission and lasting at least 7 days Delay subsequent cycle of VENCLEXTA in combination with azacitidine, decitabine, or low-dose cytarabine and monitor blood counts. Upon resolution to Grade 1 or 2, resume VENCLEXTA at the same dose in combination with azacitidine, decitabine, or low-dose cytarabine. Subsequent occurrences in cycles after achieving remission and lasting 7 days or longer Delay subsequent cycle of VENCLEXTA in combination with azacitidine, or decitabine, or low-dose cytarabine and monitor blood counts. Upon resolution to Grade 1 or 2, resume VENCLEXTA at the same dose in combination with azacitidine, decitabine, or low-dose cytarabine, and reduce VENCLEXTA duration by 7 days during each of the subsequent cycles, such as 21 days instead of 28 days. Non-Hematologic Adverse Reactions Grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicities [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] Any occurrence Interrupt VENCLEXTA if not resolved with supportive care. Upon resolution to Grade 1 or baseline level, resume VENCLEXTA at the same dose. a Recommend bone marrow evaluation. 2.6 Dosage Modifications for Drug Interactions Strong or Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors or P-gp Inhibitors Table 7 describes VENCLEXTA contraindication or dosage modification based on concomitant use with a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor or a P-gp inhibitor [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] at initiation, during, or after the ramp-up phase.

Take VENCLEXTA at approximately the same time each day. Swallow VENCLEXTA tablets whole. Do not chew, crush, or break tablets prior to swallowing. The recommended dosage of VENCLEXTA may be delivered using any of the approved tablet strengths (e.g., patients can take 2 x 50 mg tablets or 10 x 10 mg tablets instead of 1 x 100 mg tablet as needed). If the patient misses a dose of VENCLEXTA within 8 hours of the time it is usually taken, instruct the patient to take the missed dose as soon as possible and resume the normal daily dosing schedule. If a patient misses a dose by more than 8 hours, instruct the patient not to take the missed dose and resume the usual dosing schedule the next day. If the patient vomits following dosing, instruct the patient to not take an additional dose that day and to take the next prescribed dose at the usual time."
