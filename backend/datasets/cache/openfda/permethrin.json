Dandruff should move when lightly touched. \u2022 if either lice or nits (eggs) are found, treat with the creme rinse Treat \u2022 wash hair with a shampoo without conditioner. Do not use a shampoo that contains a conditioner or a conditioner alone since this may decrease the activity of the creme rinse. Rinse with water. \u2022 towel dry hair so it is damp but not wet \u2022 shake the bottle well \u2022 completely saturate the hair and scalp with the creme rinse. Begin to apply the creme rinse behind the ears and at the back of the neck. \u2022 keep the creme rinse out of the eyes. Protect the eyes with a washcloth or towel. \u2022 leave the creme rinse on the hair for 10 minutes, but no longer \u2022 rinse with warm water \u2022 towel dry hair and comb out tangles \u2022 if live lice are seen seven days or more after the first treatment, a second treatment should be given Remove Lice/Nits \u2022 remove nits by combing the hair with the special small tooth comb provided.

Work on one section at a time. Longer hair may take more time (1-2 hours). \u2022 start at the top of the head on the section you have picked \u2022 with one hand, lift a 1-2 inch wide strand of hair. Get the teeth of the comb as close to the scalp as possible and comb with a firm, even motion away from the scalp to the end of the hair. \u2022 use clips to pin back each strand of hair after you have combed out the nits \u2022 clean the comb completely as you go. Wipe the nits from the comb with a tissue and throw away the tissue in a sealed plastic bag to prevent the lice from coming back. \u2022 after combing, recheck the entire head for nits and repeat combing if necessary \u2022 check the affected head daily to remove any nits that you might have missed"
