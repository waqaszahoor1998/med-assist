    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong or Moderate Cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A Inhibitors : Avoid coadministration of strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors with TAZVERIK. Reduce the dose of TAZVERIK if coadministration of strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors cannot be avoided. ( 2.3 , 7.1 ) Strong or Moderate CYP3A Inducers : Avoid coadministration with TAZVERIK. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on TAZVERIK Strong or Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Coadministration of TAZVERIK with a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor increases tazemetostat plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )], which may increase the frequency or severity of adverse reactions. Avoid coadministration of strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors with TAZVERIK. If coadministration of strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors cannot be avoided, reduce TAZVERIK dose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )]. Strong or Moderate CYP3A Inducers Coadministration of TAZVERIK with a strong CYP3A inducer decreases tazemetostat plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , and coadministration of TAZVERIK with a moderate CYP3A inducer may also decrease tazemetostat plasma concentrations. The decrease in tazemetostat plasma concentration may decrease the efficacy of TAZVERIK. Avoid coadministration of moderate or strong CYP3A inducers with TAZVERIK. 7.2 Effect of TAZVERIK on Other Drugs CYP3A Substrates Coadministration of TAZVERIK with CYP3A substrates, including hormonal contraceptives, can result in decreased concentrations and reduced efficacy of CYP3A substrates [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.3 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in labeling: Secondary Malignancies [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. The most common (\u226520%) adverse reactions in patients with epithelioid sarcoma are pain, fatigue, nausea, decreased appetite, vomiting, and constipation. ( 6.1 ) The most common (\u226520%) adverse reactions in patients with follicular lymphoma are fatigue, upper respiratory tract infection, musculoskeletal pain, nausea, and abdominal pain. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Epizyme at 855-463-5127 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Epithelioid Sarcoma The safety of TAZVERIK was evaluated in a cohort (Cohort 5) of Study EZH-202 that enrolled patients with epithelioid sarcoma [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )]. Patients received TAZVERIK 800 mg orally twice daily (n=62). Among patients who received TAZVERIK, 44% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 24% were exposed for greater than one year. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 37% of patients who received TAZVERIK. Serious adverse reactions in \u22653% of patients who received TAZVERIK were hemorrhage, pleural effusion, skin infection, dyspnea, pain, and respiratory distress. One patient (2%) permanently discontinued TAZVERIK due to an adverse reaction of altered mood. Dosage interruptions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 34% of patients who received TAZVERIK. The most frequent adverse reactions requiring dosage interruptions in \u22653% were hemorrhage, increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Dose reduction due to an adverse reaction occurred in one (2%) patient who received TAZVERIK; the dose was reduced in this patient for decreased appetite. The most common adverse reactions (\u226520%) were pain, fatigue, nausea, decreased appetite, vomiting, and constipation. Table 4 presents adverse reactions in patients with epithelioid sarcoma in Cohort 5 of Study EZH-202. Table 4.

Patients received TAZVERIK 800 mg orally twice daily (n=99). Among patients who received TAZVERIK, 68% were exposed for 6 months or longer, 39% were exposed for 12 months or longer, and 21% were exposed for 18 months or longer. The median age was 62 years (range 36 to 87 years), 54% were male, and 95% had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1. The median number of prior therapies was 3 (range 1 to 11). Patients were required to have a creatinine clearance \u226540 mL/min per the Cockcroft and Gault formula. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 30% of patients who received TAZVERIK. Serious adverse reactions in \u22652% of patients who received TAZVERIK were general physical health deterioration, abdominal pain, pneumonia, sepsis, and anemia. Permanent discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 8% of patients who received TAZVERIK. Adverse reaction resulting in permanent discontinuation in \u22652% of patients was second primary malignancy. Dosage interruptions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 28% of patients who received TAZVERIK. Adverse reactions requiring dosage interruptions in \u22653% of patients were thrombocytopenia and fatigue. Dose reduction due to an adverse reaction occurred in 9% of patients who received TAZVERIK. The most common adverse reactions (\u226520%) were fatigue, upper respiratory tract infection, musculoskeletal pain, nausea, and abdominal pain.

    "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended dosage is 800 mg taken orally twice daily with or without food. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Patient Selection Select patients with R/R FL for treatment with TAZVERIK based on the presence of EZH2 mutation of codons Y646, A682, or A692 in tumor specimens [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . Information on FDA-approved tests for the detection of EZH2 mutation in relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma is available at: http://www.fda.gov/CompanionDiagnostics. 2.2 Recommended Dosage The recommended dosage of TAZVERIK is 800 mg orally twice daily with or without food until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Swallow tablets whole. Do not cut, crush, or chew tablets. Do not take an additional dose if a dose is missed or vomiting occurs after TAZVERIK, but continue with the next scheduled dose. 2.3 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions Table 1 summarizes the recommended dose reductions, and Table 2 summarizes the recommended dosage modifications of TAZVERIK for adverse reactions. Table 1. Recommended Dose Reductions of TAZVERIK for Adverse Reactions *Permanently discontinue TAZVERIK in patients who are unable to tolerate 400 mg orally twice daily. Dose Reduction Dosage First 600 mg orally twice daily Second 400 mg orally twice daily* Table 2. Recommended Dosage Modifications of TAZVERIK for Adverse Reactions Adverse Reaction Severity Dosage Modification Neutropenia [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] Neutrophil count less than 1 \u00d7 10 9 /L Withhold until neutrophil count is greater than or equal to 1 \u00d7 10 9 /L or baseline. For first occurrence, resume at same dose. For second and third occurrence, resume at reduced dose. Permanently discontinue after fourth occurrence. Thrombocytopenia [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] Platelet count less than 50 \u00d7 10 9 /L Withhold until platelet count is greater than or equal to 75 \u00d7 10 9 /L or baseline. For first and second occurrence, resume at reduced dose. Permanently discontinue after third occurrence. Anemia [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] Hemoglobin less than 8 g/dL Withhold until improvement to at least Grade 1 or baseline, then resume at same or reduced dose. Other adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] Grade 3 Withhold until improvement to at least Grade 1 or baseline. For first and second occurrence, resume at reduced dose. Permanently discontinue after third occurrence. Grade 4 Withhold until improvement to at least Grade 1 or baseline. For first occurrence, resume at reduced dose. Permanently discontinue after second occurrence. 2.4 Dosage Modifications for Drug Interactions Strong or Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Avoid coadministration of TAZVERIK with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors. If coadministration with a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor cannot be avoided, reduce the TAZVERIK dose as shown in Table 3 below. After discontinuation of the strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor for 3 elimination half-lives, resume the TAZVERIK dose that was taken prior to initiating the inhibitor [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Table 3. Recommended Dose Reductions of TAZVERIK for Strong or Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Current Dosage Adjusted Dosage 800 mg orally twice daily 400 mg orally twice daily 600 mg orally twice daily 400 mg for first dose and 200 mg for second dose 400 mg orally twice daily 200 mg orally twice daily"
