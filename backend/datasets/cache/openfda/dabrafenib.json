    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Avoid concurrent administration of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2C8. ( 7.1 ) Concomitant use with agents that are sensitive substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2B6 may result in loss of efficacy of these agents. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on TAFINLAR Strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2C8 may increase the concentration of dabrafenib [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Substitution of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2C8 is recommended during treatment with TAFINLAR. If concomitant use of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 or CYP2C8 is unavoidable, monitor patients closely for adverse reactions when taking strong inhibitors. 7.2 Effects of TAFINLAR on Other Drugs Dabrafenib decreased the systemic exposures of midazolam (a CYP3A4 substrate), S-warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate), and R-warfarin (a CYP3A4/CYP1A2 substrate) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Monitor international normalized ratio (INR) levels more frequently in patients receiving warfarin during initiation or discontinuation of dabrafenib. Coadministration of TAFINLAR with other substrates of these enzymes, including dexamethasone or hormonal contraceptives , can result in decreased concentrations and loss of efficacy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8. 3 )] . Substitute for these medications or monitor patients for loss of efficacy if use of these medications is unavoidable."

Adult Safety Pools The pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to TAFINLAR 150 mg orally, twice daily as a single agent in 586 patients with various solid tumors, including BRAF V600 mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma, enrolled in BREAK-2, BREAK-3, BREAK-MB, BRF113220, and BRF112680. Among these 586 patients who received TAFINLAR as a single agent, 46% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 15% were exposed for greater than one year. The pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to TAFINLAR 150 mg orally, twice daily, administered in combination with trametinib 2 mg orally, once daily, in 1087 patients enrolled in COMBI-d, COMBI-v, COMBI-AD, and BRF113928 with unresectable or metastatic melanoma, adjuvant melanoma, or NSCLC. Among these 1087 patients who received TAFINLAR administered with trametinib, 70% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 21% were exposed for greater than one year. Pediatric Safety Pool The pediatric pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to weight-based TAFINLAR orally, twice daily administered in combination with trametinib in 166 pediatric patients across two trials: a multi-center, open-label, multi-cohort study in pediatric patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive glioma requiring systemic therapy (Study G2201; n = 123) and a multi-center, open-label, multi-cohort study in pediatric patients with refractory or recurrent solid tumors with MAPK pathway activation (Study X2101; n = 43) [see Clinical Studies (14.6, 14.7)] . Among 166 patients who received TAFINLAR administered with trametinib, 84% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 70% were exposed for greater than one year. The most common (> 20%) adverse reactions were pyrexia (66%), rash (54%), headache (40%), vomiting (38%), musculoskeletal pain (36%), fatigue (31%), dry skin (31%), diarrhea (30%), nausea (26%), epistaxis and other bleeding events (25%), abdominal pain (24%), and dermatitis acneiform (23%). The most common (> 2%) Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities were decreased neutrophil count (20%), increased alanine aminotransferase (3.1%), and increased aspartate aminotransferase (3.1%). Unresectable or Metastatic BRAF V600E or V600K Mutation-Positive Melanoma TAFINLAR as a Single Agent The safety of TAFINLAR was evaluated in BREAK-3, a multi-center, international, open-label, randomized (3:1), controlled trial that allocated 250 patients with unresectable or metastatic BRAF V600E mutation-positive melanoma to receive TAFINLAR 150 mg orally twice daily (n = 187) or dacarbazine 1000 mg/m 2 intravenously every 3 weeks (n = 63) [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . The trial excluded patients with abnormal LVEF or cardiac valve morphology (\u2265 Grade 2), corrected QT interval \u2265 480 milliseconds on electrocardiogram, or a known history of G6PD deficiency. The median duration on treatment was 4.9 months for patients treated with TAFINLAR and 2.8 months for dacarbazine-treated patients. The population exposed to TAFINLAR was 60% male, 99% White, and had a median age of 53 years. The most common adverse reactions (\u2265 20%) in patients treated with TAFINLAR were, in order of decreasing frequency: hyperkeratosis, headache, pyrexia, arthralgia, papilloma, alopecia, and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (PPES). The incidence of adverse events resulting in permanent discontinuation of study medication in the BREAK-3 study was 3% for patients treated with TAFINLAR and 3% for patients treated with dacarbazine. The most frequent (\u2265 2%) adverse reactions leading to dose reduction of TAFINLAR were pyrexia (9%), PPES (3%), chills (3%), fatigue (2%), and headache (2%).

Patients with low-grade glioma (LGG) who required first systemic therapy were randomized (2:1) to TAFINLAR plus trametinib (n = 73) or carboplatin plus vincristine (n = 33). Nine patients crossed over from the carboplatin plus vincristine arm to the TAFINLAR and trametinib arm. Pediatric patients received weight-based TAFINLAR orally twice daily administered in combination with trametinib until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Patients in the control arm received carboplatin and vincristine at doses of 175 mg/m 2 and 1.5 mg/m 2 , respectively in 10-week induction course followed by eight 6-week cycles of maintenance therapy or until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Among patients with low-grade glioma who were randomized to TAFINLAR plus trametinib (n = 73), 95% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 71% were exposed for greater than one year. The median age of these patients was 10 years (range: 1 to 17); 60% female; 75% White, 7% Asian, 2.7% Black or African American, 4% other race, and 11% where race was unknown or not reported.
