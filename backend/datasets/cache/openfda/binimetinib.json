    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: \u2022 New Primary Malignancies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] \u2022 Cardiomyopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] \u2022 Venous Thromboembolism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] \u2022 Ocular Toxicities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] \u2022 Interstitial Lung Disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] \u2022 Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] \u2022 Rhabdomyolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] \u2022 Hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] \u2022 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] \u2022 Risks Associated with Combination Treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] Melanoma: Most common adverse reactions (\u226525%) for MEKTOVI, in combination with encorafenib, are fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. ( 6.1 ) NSCLC: Most common adverse reactions (\u226525%) for MEKTOVI, in combination with encorafenib, are fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, musculoskeletal pain, vomiting, abdominal pain, visual impairment, constipation, dyspnea, rash, and cough.

The data described in WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflect exposure of 192 patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma to MEKTOVI 45 mg twice daily in combination with encorafenib 450 mg once daily in a randomized open-label, active-controlled trial (COLUMBUS) [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] or, for rare events, exposure of 690 patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma to MEKTOVI 45 mg twice daily in combination with encorafenib once daily across multiple clinical trials (NCT03915951, NCT01909453). The pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS also reflect exposure of 98 patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer to MEKTOVI 45 mg twice daily and encorafenib 450 mg once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity in PHAROS [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . BRAF V600E or V600K Mutation-Positive Unresectable or Metastatic Melanoma The data described below reflect exposure of 192 patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma to MEKTOVI (45 mg twice daily) in combination with encorafenib (450 mg once daily) in COLUMBUS. The COLUMBUS trial [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] excluded patients with a history of Gilbert's syndrome, abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction, prolonged QTc (>480 msec), uncontrolled hypertension, and history or current evidence of retinal vein occlusion. The median duration of exposure was 11.8 months for patients treated with MEKTOVI in combination with encorafenib and 6.2 months for patients treated with vemurafenib. The most common (\u226525%) adverse reactions in patients receiving MEKTOVI in combination with encorafenib were fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Adverse reactions leading to dose interruptions of MEKTOVI occurred in 33% of patients receiving MEKTOVI in combination with encorafenib; the most common were left ventricular dysfunction (6%) and serous retinopathy (5%). Adverse reactions leading to dose reductions of MEKTOVI occurred in 19% of patients receiving MEKTOVI in combination with encorafenib; the most common were left ventricular dysfunction (3%), serous retinopathy (3%), and colitis (2%). Five percent (5%) of patients receiving MEKTOVI in combination with encorafenib experienced an adverse reaction that resulted in permanent discontinuation of MEKTOVI. The most common adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of MEKTOVI were hemorrhage in 2% and headache in 1% of patients. Table 3 and Table 4 present adverse drug reactions and laboratory abnormalities, respectively, identified in COLUMBUS. The COLUMBUS trial was not designed to demonstrate a statistically significant difference in adverse reaction rates for MEKTOVI in combination with encorafenib, as compared to vemurafenib, for any specific adverse reaction listed in Table 3.

The PHAROS trial [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] excluded patients with abnormal LVEF, prolonged QTc (>480 ms), uncontrolled hypertension, and history or current evidence of retinal vein occlusion. The median duration of treatment for MEKTOVI and encorafenib was 8.4 and 9.2 months respectively. The most common (\u226525%) adverse reactions in patients receiving MEKTOVI were fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, musculoskeletal pain, vomiting, abdominal pain, visual impairment, constipation, dyspnea, rash, and cough. Adverse reactions leading to dose interruptions of MEKTOVI occurred in 62% of patients receiving MEKTOVI; the most common (\u22655%) were diarrhea (17%); nausea (15%); fatigue (9%); AST increased (7%); ALT increased, anemia, musculoskeletal pain, vomiting (6% each); and acute kidney injury, hemorrhage, and LV dysfunction/cardiomyopathy (5% each). Adverse reactions leading to dose reductions of MEKTOVI occurred in 33% of patients receiving MEKTOVI; the most common (\u22655%) were diarrhea (8%), nausea (6%), and AST increased (5%). A total of 17% of patients receiving MEKTOVI experienced an adverse reaction that resulted in permanent discontinuation of MEKTOVI; the most common (\u22652%) were diarrhea (3.1%); musculoskeletal pain, LV dysfunction/cardiomyopathy, fatigue, nausea, rash, visual impairment, and vomiting (2% each). None of the other adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation of MEKTOVI occurred in more than 1 patient.
