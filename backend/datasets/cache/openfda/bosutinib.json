    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022 Strong and Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors: Avoid concomitant use with BOSULIF. ( 7.1 ) \u2022 Strong CYP3A Inducers: Avoid concomitant use with BOSULIF. ( 7.1 ) \u2022 Proton Pump Inhibitors: Use short-acting antacids or H2 blockers as an alternative to proton pump inhibitors. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on BOSULIF Strong or Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Avoid the concomitant use of strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors with BOSULIF. Bosutinib is a CYP3A substrate. Concomitant use with a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor increases bosutinib C max and AUC [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] which may increase the risk of toxicities. Strong CYP3A Inducers Avoid the concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers with BOSULIF. Bosutinib is a CYP3A substrate. Concomitant use with a strong CYP3A inducer decreases bosutinib C max and AUC [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] which may reduce BOSULIF efficacy. Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPI) As an alternative to PPIs, use short-acting antacids or H2 blockers and separate dosing by more than 2 hours from BOSULIF dosing. Bosutinib displays pH dependent aqueous solubility, Concomitant use with a PPI decreases bosutinib C max and AUC [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] which may reduce BOSULIF efficacy."

    "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Adult patients with newly-diagnosed chronic phase Ph+ CML: 400 mg orally once daily with food. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Adult patients with chronic, accelerated, or blast phase Ph+ CML with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy: 500 mg orally once daily with food. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Pediatric patients with newly-diagnosed chronic phase Ph+ CML: 300 mg/m 2 orally once daily with food. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Pediatric patients with chronic phase Ph+ CML with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy: 400 mg/m 2 orally once daily with food. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Consider dose escalation by increments of 100 mg once daily to a maximum of 600 mg daily in adult patients who do not reach complete hematologic, cytogenetic, or molecular response and do not have Grade 3 or greater adverse reactions. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 Consider dose escalation by increments of 50 mg for those with a BSA <1.1 m 2 and 100 mg for those with a BSA \u22651.1 m 2 to a maximum of 600 mg daily in pediatric patients who do not reach sufficient response after 3 months. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 Adjust dosage for toxicity and organ impairment ( 2 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosage The recommended dosage is taken orally once daily with food. Swallow tablets whole. Do not cut, crush, break or chew tablets. Continue treatment with BOSULIF until disease progression or intolerance to therapy. Capsules may be swallowed whole. For patients who are unable to swallow a whole capsule(s), each capsule can be opened and the contents mixed with applesauce or yogurt. Mixing the capsule contents with applesauce or yogurt cannot be considered a substitute of a proper meal. If a dose is missed beyond 12 hours, the patient should skip the dose and take the usual prescribed dose on the following day. Dosage in Adult Patients with Newly-Diagnosed CP Ph+ CML The recommended dosage of BOSULIF is 400 mg orally once daily with food. Dosage in Adult Patients with CP, AP, or BP Ph+ CML with Resistance or Intolerance to Prior Therapy The recommended dosage of BOSULIF is 500 mg orally once daily with food. Dosage in Pediatric Patients with Newly-Diagnosed CP Ph+ CML or with CP Ph+ CML with Resistance or Intolerance to Prior Therapy The recommended dose of BOSULIF for pediatric patients with newly-diagnosed CP Ph+ CML is 300 mg/m 2 orally once daily with food and the recommended dosage for pediatric patients with CP Ph+ CML that is resistant or intolerant to prior therapy is 400 mg/m 2 orally once daily with food and dose recommendations are provided in Table 1. As appropriate, the desired dose can be attained by combining different strengths of BOSULIF tablets or capsules. Table 1: Dosing of BOSULIF for Pediatric Patients with Newly-Diagnosed CP Ph+ CML or with CP Ph+ CML with Resistance or Intolerance to Prior Therapy BSA BSA=Body Surface Area Newly-Diagnosed Recommended Dose (Once Daily) Resistant or Intolerant Recommended Dose (Once Daily) < 0.55 m 2 150 mg 200 mg 0.55 to < 0.63 m 2 200 mg 250 mg 0.63 to < 0.75 m 2 200 mg 300 mg 0.75 to < 0.9 m 2 250 mg 350 mg 0.9 to < 1.1 m 2 300 mg 400 mg \u2265 1.1 m 2 400 mg maximum starting dose (corresponding to maximum starting dose in adult indication) 500 mg Preparation Instructions for BOSULIF Capsules Mixed with Applesauce or Yogurt For patients who are unable to swallow capsules, the contents of the capsules can be mixed with applesauce or yogurt. Remove the required number of capsules from the container to prepare the dose as instructed and the amount of either room temperature applesauce or yogurt in a clean container. Carefully open each capsule, add the entire capsule content of each capsule into the applesauce or yogurt, then mix the entire dose into the applesauce or yogurt. Patients should immediately consume the full mixture in its entirety, without chewing. Do not store the mixture for later use. If the entire preparation is not swallowed do not take an additional dose. Wait until the next day to resume dosing. Table 2: BOSULIF Dose Using Capsules and Soft Food Volumes Dose Volume of Applesauce or Yogurt 100 mg 10 mL (2 teaspoons) 150 mg 15 mL (3 teaspoons) 200 mg 20 mL (4 teaspoons) 250 mg 25 mL (5 teaspoons) 300 mg 30 mL (6 teaspoons) 350 mg 30 mL (6 teaspoons) 400 mg 35 mL (7 teaspoons) 450 mg 40 mL (8 teaspoons) 500 mg 45 mL (9 teaspoons) 550 mg 45 mL (9 teaspoons) 600 mg 50 mL (10 teaspoons) 2.2 Dose Escalation In clinical studies of adult patients with Ph+ CML, dose escalation by increments of 100 mg once daily to a maximum of 600 mg once daily was allowed in patients who did not achieve or maintain a hematologic, cytogenetic, or molecular response and who did not have Grade 3 or higher adverse reactions at the recommended starting dosage. In pediatric patients with BSA <1.1 m 2 and an insufficient response after 3 months consider increasing dose by 50 mg increments up to maximum of 100 mg above starting dose. Dose increases for insufficient response in pediatric patients with BSA \u22651.1 m 2 can be conducted similarly to adult recommendations in 100 mg increments. The maximum dose in pediatric and adult patients is 600 mg once daily. 2.3 Dosage Adjustments for Non-Hematologic Adverse Reactions Elevated liver transaminases: If elevations in liver transaminases greater than 5\u00d7institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) occur, withhold BOSULIF until recovery to less than or equal to 2.5\u00d7ULN and resume at 400 mg once daily thereafter. If recovery takes longer than 4 weeks, discontinue BOSULIF. If transaminase elevations greater than or equal to 3\u00d7ULN occur concurrently with bilirubin elevations greater than 2\u00d7ULN and alkaline phosphatase less than 2\u00d7ULN (Hy's law case definition), discontinue BOSULIF [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Diarrhea: For National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Grade 3\u20134 diarrhea (increase of greater than or equal to 7 stools/day over baseline/pretreatment), withhold BOSULIF until recovery to Grade less than or equal to 1. BOSULIF may be resumed at 400 mg once daily [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . For other clinically significant, moderate or severe non-hematological toxicity, withhold BOSULIF until the toxicity has resolved, then consider resuming BOSULIF at a dose reduced by 100 mg taken once daily. If clinically appropriate, consider re-escalating the dose of BOSULIF to the starting dose taken once daily. In pediatric patients, dose adjustments for non-hematologic toxicities can be conducted similarly to adults, however the dose reduction increments may differ. For pediatric patients with BSA <1.1 m 2 , reduce dose by 50 mg initially followed by additional 50 mg increment if the adverse reaction (AR) persists. For pediatric patients with BSA \u22651.1 m 2 or greater, reduce dose similarly to adults. 2.4 Dosage Adjustments for Myelosuppression Dose reductions for severe or persistent neutropenia and thrombocytopenia are described below (Table 3). Table 3: Dose Adjustments for Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia in Adult and Pediatric Patients ANC Absolute Neutrophil Count less than 1000\u00d710 6 /L or Platelets less than 50,000\u00d710 6 /L Withhold BOSULIF until ANC greater than or equal to1000\u00d710 6 /L and platelets greater than or equal to 50,000\u00d710 6 /L. Resume treatment with BOSULIF at the same dose if recovery occurs within 2 weeks. If blood counts remain low for greater than 2 weeks, upon recovery, reduce dose by 100 mg and resume treatment, or by 50 mg in pediatric patients with BSA <1.1 m 2 and resume treatment. If cytopenia recurs, reduce dose by an additional 100 mg upon recovery and resume treatment, or by an additional 50 mg in pediatric patients with BSA <1.1 m 2 and resume treatment. 2.5 Dosage Adjustments for Renal Impairment or Hepatic Impairment The recommended starting doses for patients with renal and hepatic impairment are described in Table 4 below. Table 4: Dose Adjustments for Renal and Hepatic Impairment in Adult Patients Recommended Starting Dosage [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6 , 8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .
