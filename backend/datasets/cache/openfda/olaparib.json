( 2.4 , 7.2 , 12.3 ) \u2022 Strong or moderate CYP3A inducers: Avoid concomitant use. ( 7.2 , 12.3 ) 7.1 Use with Anticancer Agents Clinical studies of Lynparza with other myelosuppressive anticancer agents, including DNA damaging agents, indicate a potentiation and prolongation of myelosuppressive toxicity. 7.2 Effect of Other Drugs on Lynparza Strong and Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Coadministration of CYP3A inhibitors can increase olaparib concentrations, which may increase the risk for adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Avoid coadministration of strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors. If the strong or moderate inhibitor must be coadministered, reduce the dose of Lynparza [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. Strong and Moderate CYP3A Inducers Concomitant use with a strong or moderate CYP3A inducer decreased olaparib exposure, which may reduce Lynparza efficacy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Avoid coadministration of strong or moderate CYP3A inducers."
