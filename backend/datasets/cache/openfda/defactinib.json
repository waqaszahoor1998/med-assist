    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors : Avoid concomitant use with AVMAPKI FAKZYNJA CO-PACK. ( 7.1 ) Strong and moderate CYP3A4 inducers : Avoid concomitant use with AVMAPKI FAKZYNJA CO-PACK. ( 7.1 ) Warfarin : Avoid concomitant use of AVMAPKI FAKZYNJA CO-PACK with warfarin and use an alternative to warfarin. ( 7.2 ) Gastric acid reducing agents : Avoid concomitant use of AVMAPKI FAKZYNJA CO-PACK with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or H2 receptor antagonists. If use of an acid-reducing agent cannot be avoided, administer FAKZYNJA 2 hours before or 2 hours after the administration of a locally acting antacid. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on AVMAPKI FAKZYNJA CO-PACK Strong and Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitors Avoid concomitant use of AVMAPKI FAKZYNJA CO-PACK with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors. Defactinib is a CYP3A4 substrate. Concomitant use of defactinib with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor increases defactinib exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ], which may increase the risk of AVMAPKI FAKZYNJA CO-PACK adverse reactions. Strong and Moderate CYP3A4 Inducers Avoid concomitant use of AVMAPKI FAKZYNJA CO-PACK with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers. Defactinib is a CYP3A4 substrate. Concomitant use of defactinib with a strong CYP3A4 inducer decreases defactinib exposure, which may reduce the effectiveness of FAKZYNJA [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Gastric Acid Reducing Agents Avoid concomitant use of AVMAPKI FAKZYNJA CO-PACK with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or H2 receptor antagonists. If concomitant use of an acid-reducing agent cannot be avoided, administer FAKZYNJA 2 hours before or 2 hours after the administration of a locally acting antacid. Concomitant use of FAKZYNJA with gastric acid reducing agents decreases defactinib exposure, which may reduce the effectiveness of AVMAPKI FAKZYNJA CO-PACK [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.2 Effect of AVMAPKI FAKZYNJA CO-PACK on Other Drugs Warfarin Avoid concomitant use of AVMAPKI FAKZYNJA CO-PACK with warfarin. For patients requiring anticoagulation, an alternative to warfarin is recommended. If concomitant use is unavoidable, monitor INR frequently during treatment with AVMAPKI FAKZYNJA CO-PACK. Cases of bleeding and increased INR occurred in patients taking FAKZYNJA concomitantly with warfarin in clinical trials."

( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Verastem at 1-833-633-8786 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The pooled safety population described in Warnings and Precautions reflect exposure to the AVMAPKI FAKZYNJA CO-PACK (combination of AVMAPKI 3.2 mg twice weekly and FAKZYNJA 200 mg twice daily) for the first 3 weeks in a 4-week cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity in 136 adult patients with recurrent LGSOC treated on RAMP-201 and FRAME (NCT03875820). The median duration of treatment was 10 months (range 0 to 51 months). RAMP-201 The safety of AVMAPKI FAKZYNJA CO-PACK was evaluated in RAMP-201, a single-arm multicenter trial in 57 patients with KRAS- mutated recurrent LGSOC [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Patients received AVMAPKI FAKZYNJA CO-PACK (AVMAPKI 3.2 mg twice weekly and FAKZYNJA 200 mg twice daily) for the first 3 weeks in a 4-week cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The median duration of treatment was 12 months (range 0.03-40). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 32% of patients who received AVMAPKI FAKZYNJA CO-PACK. The most common (\u22652%) serious adverse reactions were sepsis (9%), intestinal obstruction (3.6%), pyelonephritis (3.6%), and hydronephrosis (3.6%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 3.6% of patients who received AVMAPKI FAKZYNJA CO-PACK, including intestinal obstruction (1.8%) and perforation (1.8%). Permanent discontinuation of AVMAPKI FAKZYNJA CO-PACK due to an adverse reaction occurred in 14% of patients. The adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation included elevations in creatine phosphokinase, dyspnea, malaise, decreased glomerular filtration rate, hyperbilirubinemia, increased alanine aminotransferase, and abdominal pain (1.8% each). Dosage interruptions of AVMAPKI FAKZYNJA CO-PACK due to an adverse reaction occurred in 84% of patients. Adverse reactions which required dosage interruptions in \u2265 5% of patients included elevations in creatine phosphokinase (25%), hyperbilirubinemia (25%), diarrhea (12%), edema (11%), fatigue (9%), vision blurred (9%), vitreoretinal disorders (7%), transaminitis (7%), paronychia (5%), nausea (5%), abdominal pain (5%), vomiting (5%), dyspnea (5%), sepsis (5%), and rash (5%). Dose reductions of AVMAPKI FAKZYNJA CO-PACK due to an adverse reaction occurred in 44% of patients. Adverse reactions which required dose reductions in \u2265 5% of patients were elevations in creatine phosphokinase (9%), fatigue (5%), hyperbilirubinemia (5%), and dermatitis acneiform (5%). The most common (\u226525%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were increased creatine phosphokinase, nausea, fatigue, increased aspartate aminotransferase, rash, diarrhea, musculoskeletal pain, edema, decreased hemoglobin, increased alanine aminotransferase, vomiting, increased blood bilirubin, increased triglycerides, decreased lymphocyte count, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, dermatitis acneiform, vitreoretinal disorders, increased alkaline phosphatase, stomatitis, pruritus, visual impairment, decreased platelet count, constipation, dry skin, dyspnea, cough, urinary tract infection, and decreased neutrophil count.
