    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS CYP3A Inhibitors: Avoid concomitant use of ketoconazole. Reduce the VERZENIO dose with concomitant use of other strong and moderate CYP3A inhibitors. ( 2.2 , 7.1 ) CYP3A Inducers: Avoid concomitant use of strong and moderate CYP3A inducers. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on VERZENIO CYP3A Inhibitors Strong and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors increased the exposure of abemaciclib plus its active metabolites to a clinically meaningful extent and may lead to increased toxicity. Ketoconazole Avoid concomitant use of ketoconazole. Ketoconazole is predicted to increase the AUC of abemaciclib by up to 16-fold [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Other Strong CYP3A Inhibitors In patients with recommended starting doses of 200 mg twice daily or 150 mg twice daily, reduce the VERZENIO dose to 100 mg twice daily with concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors other than ketoconazole. In patients who have had a dose reduction to 100 mg twice daily due to adverse reactions, further reduce the VERZENIO dose to 50 mg twice daily with concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors. If a patient taking VERZENIO discontinues a strong CYP3A inhibitor, increase the VERZENIO dose (after 3-5 half-lives of the inhibitor) to the dose that was used before starting the inhibitor. Patients should avoid grapefruit products [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors With concomitant use of moderate CYP3A inhibitors, monitor for adverse reactions and consider reducing the VERZENIO dose in 50 mg decrements as demonstrated in Table 1 , if necessary. Strong and Moderate CYP3A Inducers Coadministration of strong or moderate CYP3A inducers decreased the plasma concentrations of abemaciclib plus its active metabolites and may lead to reduced activity. Avoid concomitant use of strong or moderate CYP3A inducers and consider alternative agents [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

The safety population described in the Warnings and Precautions reflect exposure to VERZENIO in 3691 patients from four clinical trials: monarchE, MONARCH 1, MONARCH 2, and MONARCH 3. The safety population includes exposure to VERZENIO as a single agent at 200 mg twice daily in 132 patients in MONARCH 1 and to VERZENIO at 150 mg twice daily in 3559 patients administered in combination with fulvestrant, tamoxifen, or an aromatase inhibitor in monarchE, MONARCH 2, and MONARCH 3. The median duration of exposure ranged from 4.5 months in MONARCH 1 to 24 months in monarchE. The most common adverse reactions (incidence \u226520%) across clinical trials were: diarrhea, neutropenia, nausea, abdominal pain, infections, fatigue, anemia, leukopenia, decreased appetite, vomiting, headache, alopecia, and thrombocytopenia. Early Breast Cancer monarchE: VERZENIO in Combination with Tamoxifen or an Aromatase Inhibitor as Adjuvant Treatment Adult patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative, node-positive early breast cancer at a high risk of recurrence The safety of VERZENIO was evaluated in monarchE, a study of 5591 adult patients receiving VERZENIO plus endocrine therapy (tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor) or endocrine therapy (tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor) alone [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )]. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 150 mg of VERZENIO orally, twice daily, plus tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor, or tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor, for two years or until discontinuation criteria were met. The median duration of VERZENIO treatment was 24 months. The most frequently reported (\u22655%) Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were neutropenia, leukopenia, diarrhea, and lymphopenia. Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 0.8% of patients who received VERZENIO plus endocrine therapy (tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor), including: cardiac failure (0.1%), cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, ventricular fibrillation, cerebral hemorrhage, cerebrovascular accident, pneumonitis, hypoxia, diarrhea, and mesenteric artery thrombosis (0.03% each). Permanent VERZENIO treatment discontinuation due to an adverse reaction was reported in 19% of patients receiving VERZENIO, plus tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor. Of the patients receiving tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor, 1% permanently discontinued due to an adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions leading to VERZENIO discontinuations were diarrhea (5%), fatigue (2%), and neutropenia (0.9%). Dose interruption of VERZENIO due to an adverse reaction occurred in 62% of patients receiving VERZENIO plus tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors. Adverse reactions leading to VERZENIO dose interruptions in \u22655% of patients were diarrhea (20%), neutropenia (16%), leukopenia (7%), and fatigue (5%). Dose reductions of VERZENIO due to an adverse reaction occurred in 44% of patients receiving VERZENIO plus endocrine therapy (tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor). Adverse reactions leading to VERZENIO dose reductions in \u22655% were diarrhea (17%), neutropenia (8%), and fatigue (5%). The most common adverse reactions reported (\u226520%) in the VERZENIO, plus tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor, arm and \u22652% higher than the tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor arm were: diarrhea, infections, neutropenia, fatigue, leukopenia, nausea, anemia, and headache.

Dose interruption of VERZENIO due to an adverse reaction occurred in 56% of patients receiving VERZENIO plus anastrozole or letrozole. Adverse reactions leading to VERZENIO dose interruptions in \u22655% of patients were neutropenia (16%) and diarrhea (15%). Dose reductions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 43% of patients receiving VERZENIO plus anastrozole or letrozole. Adverse reactions leading to dose reductions in \u22655% of patients were diarrhea and neutropenia. VERZENIO dose reductions due to diarrhea of any grade occurred in 13% of patients receiving VERZENIO plus an aromatase inhibitor compared to 2% of patients receiving placebo plus an aromatase inhibitor. VERZENIO dose reductions due to neutropenia of any grade occurred in 11% of patients receiving VERZENIO plus an aromatase inhibitor compared to 0.6% of patients receiving placebo plus an aromatase inhibitor. The most common adverse reactions reported (\u226520%) in the VERZENIO arm and \u22652% than the placebo arm were: diarrhea, neutropenia, fatigue, infections, nausea, abdominal pain, anemia, vomiting, alopecia, decreased appetite, and leukopenia. Adverse reactions are shown in Table 10 and laboratory abnormalities in Table 11 . Diarrhea incidence was greatest during the first month of VERZENIO dosing. The median time to onset of the first diarrhea event was 8 days, and the median durations of diarrhea for Grades 2 and for Grade 3 were 11 days and 8 days, respectively. Most diarrhea events recovered or resolved (88%) with supportive treatment and/or dose reductions [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )] . Nineteen percent of patients with diarrhea required a dose omission and 13% required a dose reduction. The median time to the first dose reduction due to diarrhea was 38 days.

Across the clinical studies, increases in serum creatinine (mean increase, 0.2-0.3 mg/dL) occurred within the first 28-day cycle of VERZENIO dosing, remained elevated but stable through the treatment period, and were reversible upon treatment discontinuation. Alternative markers such as BUN, cystatin C, or calculated GFR, which are not based on creatinine, may be considered to determine whether renal function is impaired. MONARCH 2: VERZENIO in Combination with Fulvestrant Women with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer with disease progression on or after prior adjuvant or metastatic endocrine therapy The safety of VERZENIO (150 mg twice daily) plus fulvestrant (500 mg) versus placebo plus fulvestrant was evaluated in MONARCH 2 [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . The data described below reflect exposure to VERZENIO in 441 patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who received at least one dose of VERZENIO plus fulvestrant in MONARCH 2. Median duration of treatment was 12 months for patients receiving VERZENIO plus fulvestrant and 8 months for patients receiving placebo plus fulvestrant. The most frequently reported (\u22655%) Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were neutropenia, diarrhea, leukopenia, anemia, and infections. Deaths during treatment or during the 30-day follow up, regardless of causality, were reported in 18 cases (4%) of VERZENIO plus fulvestrant treated patients versus 10 cases (5%) of placebo plus fulvestrant treated patients. Causes of death for patients receiving VERZENIO plus fulvestrant included: 7 (2%) patient deaths due to underlying disease, 4 (0.9%) due to sepsis, 2 (0.5%) due to pneumonitis, 2 (0.5%) due to hepatotoxicity, and one (0.2%) due to cerebral infarction. Permanent study treatment discontinuation due to an adverse reaction were reported in 9% of patients receiving VERZENIO plus fulvestrant and in 3% of patients receiving placebo plus fulvestrant. Adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation for patients receiving VERZENIO plus fulvestrant were infection (2%), diarrhea (1%), hepatotoxicity (1%), fatigue (0.7%), nausea (0.2%), abdominal pain (0.2%), acute kidney injury (0.2%), and cerebral infarction (0.2%). Dose interruption of VERZENIO due to an adverse reaction occurred in 52% of patients receiving VERZENIO plus fulvestrant. Adverse reactions leading to VERZENIO dose interruptions in \u22655% of patients were diarrhea (19%) and neutropenia (16%). Dose reductions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 43% of patients receiving VERZENIO plus fulvestrant. Adverse reactions leading to reductions in \u22655% of patients were diarrhea and neutropenia. VERZENIO dose reductions due to diarrhea of any grade occurred in 19% of patients receiving VERZENIO plus fulvestrant compared to 0.4% of patients receiving placebo and fulvestrant. VERZENIO dose reductions due to neutropenia of any grade occurred in 10% of patients receiving VERZENIO plus fulvestrant compared to no patients receiving placebo plus fulvestrant. The most common adverse reactions reported (\u226520%) in the VERZENIO arm were: diarrhea, fatigue, neutropenia, nausea, infections, abdominal pain, anemia, leukopenia, decreased appetite, vomiting, and headache. Adverse reactions are shown in Table 12 and laboratory abnormalities in Table 13 .

MONARCH 1: VERZENIO Administered as a Monotherapy in Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer who received prior endocrine therapy and 1-2 chemotherapy regimens in the metastatic setting The safety of VERZENIO was evaluated in MONARCH 1, a single-arm, open-label, multicenter study in 132 women with measurable HR-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . Patients received 200 mg VERZENIO orally twice daily until development of progressive disease or unmanageable toxicity. Median duration of treatment was 4.5 months. The most frequently reported (\u22655%) Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were diarrhea, neutropenia, fatigue, and leukopenia. Deaths due to adverse reactions during treatment or during the 30-day follow up were reported in 2% of patients. Cause of death in these patients was due to infection (2 patients) or pneumonitis (1 patient). Ten patients (8%) discontinued study treatment from adverse reactions due to (1 patient each), abdominal pain, arterial thrombosis, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased, blood creatinine increased, chronic kidney disease, diarrhea, ECG QT prolonged, fatigue, hip fracture, and lymphopenia. Dose interruption of VERZENIO due to an adverse reaction occurred in 58% of patients. The most frequent (\u22655%) adverse reactions leading to dose interruptions were diarrhea (24%), neutropenia (16%), fatigue (10%), vomiting (6%), and nausea (5%). Forty-nine percent of patients had dose reductions due to an adverse reaction. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to dose reductions were diarrhea (20%), neutropenia (11%), and fatigue (9%). The most common reported adverse reactions (\u226520%) were: diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, neutropenia, vomiting, infections, anemia, headache, and thrombocytopenia.

Table 7: VERZENIO Dose Modification and Management \u2014 Other Toxicities a a Excluding diarrhea, hematologic toxicity, hepatotoxicity, ILD/pneumonitis, and VTEs. CTCAE Grade VERZENIO Dose Modifications Grade 1 or 2 No dose modification is required. Persistent or recurrent Grade 2 toxicity that does not resolve with maximal supportive measures within 7 days to baseline or Grade 1 Suspend dose until toxicity resolves to baseline or \u2264Grade 1. Resume at next lower dose . Grade 3 or 4 Suspend dose until toxicity resolves to baseline or \u2264Grade 1. Resume at next lower dose . Refer to the Full Prescribing Information for coadministered fulvestrant, tamoxifen, or an aromatase inhibitor for dose modifications and other relevant safety information. Dose Modification for Use with Strong and Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Avoid concomitant use of the strong CYP3A inhibitor ketoconazole. With concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors other than ketoconazole, in patients with recommended starting doses of 200 mg twice daily or 150 mg twice daily, reduce the VERZENIO dose to 100 mg twice daily. In patients who have had a dose reduction to 100 mg twice daily due to adverse reactions, further reduce the VERZENIO dose to 50 mg twice daily. If a patient taking VERZENIO discontinues a CYP3A inhibitor, increase the VERZENIO dose (after 3-5 half-lives of the inhibitor) to the dose that was used before starting the strong inhibitor [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. With concomitant use of moderate CYP3A inhibitors, monitor for adverse reactions and consider reducing the VERZENIO dose in 50 mg decrements as demonstrated in Table 1 , if necessary. Dose Modification for Patients with Severe Hepatic Impairment For patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh-C), reduce the VERZENIO dosing frequency to once daily [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Refer to the Full Prescribing Information for the coadministered fulvestrant, tamoxifen, or aromatase inhibitor for dose modification requirements for severe hepatic impairment."
