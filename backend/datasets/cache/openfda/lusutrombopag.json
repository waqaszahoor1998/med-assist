    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in detail in other sections of the labeling: Thrombotic/Thromboembolic Complications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] The most common adverse reaction (\u22653%): headache. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Shionogi Inc. at 1-800-849-9707 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of MULPLETA was evaluated in 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, L-PLUS 1, L-PLUS 2, and M0626, in which patients with chronic liver disease and thrombocytopenia were treated with MULPLETA (N=171) or placebo (N=170) at a dose of 3 mg daily for up to 7 days prior to a scheduled procedure. The majority of patients were males (59%), and median age was 61 years (range 19-88). The racial and ethnic distribution was White (50%), Asian (47%), Black (<1%), and Other (3%). The most common adverse reactions (those occurring in at least 3%) in the MULPLETA-treated group across the pooled data from the three trials are summarized in table 1. Table 1. Adverse Reactions with a Frequency \u22653% in Patients Treated with MULPLETA (Pooled Data (L-PLUS 1, L-PLUS 2, and M0626)) Adverse Reaction Includes treatment-emergent adverse reactions occurring at a rate higher than placebo. MULPLETA 3 mg (N=171) % Placebo (N=170) % Headache 5 4 The incidence of serious adverse events was 5% (9 of 171 patients) in the MULPLETA group and 7% (12 of 170 patients) in the placebo group. The most common serious adverse reaction reported with MULPLETA was portal vein thrombosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . No adverse reactions resulted in discontinuation of MULPLETA."
