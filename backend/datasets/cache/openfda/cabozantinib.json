    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Reduce the COMETRIQ dosage. ( 2.2 , 7.1 ) Strong CYP3A4 Inducers: Increase the COMETRIQ dosage. ( 2.2 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Effect of CYP3A4 Inhibitors Administration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole to healthy subjects increased single-dose plasma cabozantinib exposure by 38%. Avoid taking a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, voriconazole) while taking COMETRIQ or reduce the dosage of COMETRIQ if concomitant use with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors cannot be avoided [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Avoid ingestion of foods (e.g., grapefruit, grapefruit juice) or nutritional supplements that are known to inhibit cytochrome P450 while taking COMETRIQ. 7.2 Effect of CYP3A4 Inducers Administration of a strong CYP3A4 inducer, rifampin to healthy subjects decreased single-dose plasma cabozantinib exposure by 77%. Avoid chronic co-administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital, St. John\u2019s Wort) with COMETRIQ or increase the dosage of COMETRIQ if concomitant use with strong CYP3A4 inducers cannot be avoided [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.3 Effect of MRP2 Inhibitors Concomitant administration of MRP2 inhibitors may increase the exposure to cabozantinib. Monitor patients for increased toxicity when MRP2 inhibitors (e.g., abacavir, adefovir, cidofovir, furosemide, lamivudine, nevirapine, ritonavir, probenecid, saquinavir, and tenofovir) are co-administered with COMETRIQ [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Perforations and Fistula [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Thromboembolic Events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Impaired Wound Healing [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypertension and Hypertensive Crisis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Osteonecrosis of the Jaw [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Diarrhea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Palmar-Plantar Erythrodysesthesia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Proteinuria [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] Hypocalcemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] The most common adverse reactions (\u2265 25%) are diarrhea, stomatitis, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE), decreased weight, decreased appetite, nausea, fatigue, oral pain, hair color changes, dysgeusia, hypertension, abdominal pain, and constipation. The most common laboratory abnormalities (\u2265 25%) are increased AST, increased ALT, lymphopenia, increased alkaline phosphatase, hypocalcemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, hypophosphatemia, and hyperbilirubinemia.

The safety of COMETRIQ was evaluated in 330 patients with progressive metastatic medullary thyroid cancer randomized to receive 140 mg COMETRIQ (n = 214) or placebo (n = 109) administered daily until disease progression or intolerable toxicity in a randomized, doubleblind, controlled trial (Study 1) [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . The data described below reflect a median exposure to COMETRIQ for 204 days. The population exposed to COMETRIQ was 70% male, 90% white, and had a median age of 55 years. Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 6% of patients receiving COMETRIQ and resulted from hemorrhage, pneumonia, septicemia, fistulas, cardiac arrest, respiratory failure, and unspecified death. Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 5% of patients receiving placebo and resulted from septicemia, pneumonia, and general deterioration. The COMETRIQ dose was reduced in 79% of patients receiving COMETRIQ and in 9% of patients receiving placebo. The median number of dosing delays was one in patients receiving COMETRIQ and in no patients receiving placebo. Adverse reactions led to study treatment discontinuation in 16% of patients receiving COMETRIQ. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation of COMETRIQ were: hypocalcemia, increased lipase, PPE, diarrhea, fatigue, hypertension, nausea, pancreatitis, tracheal fistula formation and vomiting. Increased levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) were observed in 57% of patients receiving COMETRIQ after the first dose compared to 19% of patients receiving placebo (regardless of baseline value). Ninety-two percent (92%) of patients on the COMETRIQ arm had a prior thyroidectomy, and 89% were taking thyroid hormone replacement prior to the first dose. Adverse reactions which occurred in \u2265 25% of COMETRIQ-treated patients occurring more frequently in the COMETRIQ arm with a between-arm difference of \u2265 5% included, in order of decreasing frequency: diarrhea, stomatitis, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE), decreased weight, decreased appetite, nausea, fatigue, oral pain, hair color changes, dysgeusia, hypertension, abdominal pain, and constipation. The most common laboratory abnormalities (\u226525%) were increased AST, increased ALT, lymphopenia, increased ALP, hypocalcemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, hypophosphatemia, and hyperbilirubinemia. Grade 3-4 adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities which occurred in \u2265 5% of COMETRIQ-treated patients occurring more frequently in the COMETRIQ arm with a between-arm difference of \u2265 2% included, in order of decreasing frequency; diarrhea, PPES, lymphopenia, hypocalcemia, fatigue, hypertension, asthenia, increased ALT, decreased weight, stomatitis, and decreased appetite ( Table 1 and Table 2 summarize the adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities reported in Study 1).

No patients developed malignant hypertension. Table 3 Per-Patient Incidence of Hypertension (Study 1) Hypertension, JNC Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure, JAMA 2003: 289:2560. Criteria applied were modified, as multiple readings were not available per timepoint, and therefore not averaged.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
