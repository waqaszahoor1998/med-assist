    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Potential interactions between Pimecrolimus Cream, 1% and other drugs, including immunizations, have not been systematically evaluated. Due to low blood levels of pimecrolimus detected in some patients after topical application, systemic drug interactions are not expected, but cannot be ruled out. The concomitant administration of known CYP3A family of inhibitors in patients with widespread and/or erythrodermic disease should be done with caution. Some examples of such drugs are erythromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, fluconazole, calcium channel blockers and cimetidine."

    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most commonly reported adverse reactions (\u22651%) were application site burning, headache, nasopharyngitis, cough, influenza, pyrexia and viral infection. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Oceanside Pharmaceuticals at 1-800-321-4576 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. No phototoxicity and no photoallergenicity were detected in clinical trials with 24 and 33 normal volunteers, respectively. In human dermal safety trials, Pimecrolimus Cream, 1% did not induce contact sensitization or cumulative irritation. In a 1-year safety trial in pediatric subjects age 2-17 years old involving sequential use of Pimecrolimus Cream, 1% and a topical corticosteroid, 43% of Pimecrolimus Cream, 1% treated subjects and 68% of vehicle-treated subjects used corticosteroids during the trial. Corticosteroids were used for more than 7 days by 34% of Pimecrolimus Cream, 1% treated subjects and 54% of vehicle-treated subjects. An increased incidence of impetigo, skin infection, superinfection (infected atopic dermatitis), rhinitis, and urticaria were found in the subjects that had used Pimecrolimus Cream, 1% and topical corticosteroid sequentially as compared to Pimecrolimus Cream, 1% alone. In three randomized, double-blind vehicle-controlled pediatric trials and one active-controlled adult trial, 843 and 328 subjects, respectively, were treated with Pimecrolimus Cream, 1%. In these clinical trials, 48 (4%) of the 1171 Pimecrolimus Cream, 1% treated subjects and 13 (3%) of 408 vehicle-treated subjects discontinued therapy due to adverse events. Discontinuations for AEs were primarily due to application site reactions and cutaneous infections. The most common application site reaction was application site burning, which occurred in 8%-26% of subjects treated with Pimecrolimus Cream, 1%. Table 1 depicts the incidence of adverse events pooled across the two identically designed 6-week trials with their open label extensions and the 1-year safety trial for pediatric subjects ages 2-17. Data from the adult active-controlled trial are also included in Table 1. Adverse events are listed regardless of relationship to trial drug. Table 1.

Causality has not been established. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Pimecrolimus Cream, 1%. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. General: Anaphylactic reactions, ocular irritation after application of the cream to the eye lids or near the eyes, angioneurotic edema, facial edema, skin flushing associated with alcohol use, skin discoloration. Hematology/Oncology: Lymphomas, basal cell carcinoma, malignant melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma."

    "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Apply a thin layer of Pimecrolimus Cream, 1% to the affected skin twice daily. The patient should stop using Pimecrolimus Cream, 1% when signs and symptoms (e.g., itch, rash and redness) resolve and should be instructed on what actions to take if symptoms recur. If signs and symptoms persist beyond 6 weeks, patients should be re-examined by their healthcare provider to confirm the diagnosis of atopic dermatitis. Continuous long-term use of Pimecrolimus Cream, 1% should be avoided, and application should be limited to areas of involvement with atopic dermatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] .
