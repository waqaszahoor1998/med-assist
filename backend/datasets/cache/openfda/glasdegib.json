    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically-significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: \u2022 QTc Interval Prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] \u2022 Musculoskeletal Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Most common adverse reactions (incidence \u226520%) are anemia, fatigue, hemorrhage, febrile neutropenia, musculoskeletal pain, nausea, edema, thrombocytopenia, dyspnea, decreased appetite, dysgeusia, mucositis, constipation, and rash. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Pfizer, Inc. at 1-800-438-1985 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety profile of DAURISMO is based on experience in the BRIGHT AML 1003 study for 111 adults with newly-diagnosed AML and 14 adults with other conditions for which DAURISMO is not indicated [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Patients were treated with DAURISMO 100 mg daily in combination with low-dose cytarabine (N=84) or low-dose cytarabine alone (N=41). The median duration of treatment in the DAURISMO with low-dose cytarabine arm was 83 days (range 3 to 972 days), and the median duration of treatment in the low-dose cytarabine alone arm was 47 days (range 6 to 239 days). The median exposure to DAURISMO in the DAURISMO with low-dose cytarabine arm was 76 days (range 3 to 954 days). Thirty-two patients (38%) were treated with DAURISMO with low-dose cytarabine for at least 6 months and 14 patients (17%) were treated for at least 1 year. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 79% of patients treated in the DAURISMO with low-dose cytarabine arm. The most common (\u22655%) serious adverse reactions in patients receiving DAURISMO with low-dose cytarabine were febrile neutropenia (29%), pneumonia (23%), hemorrhage (12%), anemia (7%), and sepsis (7%). Dose reductions associated with adverse reactions were reported in 26% of patients treated with DAURISMO with low-dose cytarabine, and the most common reasons (\u22652%) for dose reductions due to adverse reactions were muscle spasms (5%), fatigue (4%), febrile neutropenia (4%), anemia (2%), thrombocytopenia (2%), and ECG QT prolonged (2%). Adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation were reported in 36% of patients treated with DAURISMO with low-dose cytarabine, and the most common (\u22652%) reasons for permanent discontinuation were pneumonia (6%), febrile neutropenia (4%), sepsis (4%), sudden death (2%), myocardial infarction (2%), nausea (2%), and renal insufficiency (2%). Adverse reactions reported in the first 90 days of therapy on the BRIGHT AML 1003 study are shown in Table 3. Table 3.

    "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended dosage: 100 mg orally once daily. ( 2.1 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosage and Schedule The recommended dosage of DAURISMO is 100 mg orally once daily on days 1 to 28 in combination with cytarabine 20 mg subcutaneously twice daily on days 1 to 10 of each 28-day cycle in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or loss of disease control. For patients without unacceptable toxicity, treat for a minimum of 6 cycles to allow time for clinical response. Administer DAURISMO with or without food. Do not split or crush DAURISMO tablets. Administer DAURISMO about the same time each day. If a dose of DAURISMO is vomited, do not administer a replacement dose; wait until the next scheduled dose is due. If a dose of DAURISMO is missed or not taken at the usual time, administer the dose as soon as possible and at least 12 hours prior to the next scheduled dose. Return to the normal schedule the following day. Do not administer 2 doses of DAURISMO within 12 hours. 2.2 Monitoring and Dosage Modifications Assess complete blood counts, electrolytes, renal, and hepatic function prior to the initiation of DAURISMO and at least once weekly for the first month. Monitor electrolytes and renal function once monthly for the duration of therapy. Obtain creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels prior to initiating DAURISMO and as indicated clinically thereafter (e.g., if muscle symptoms are reported). Monitor electrocardiograms (ECGs) prior to the initiation of DAURISMO, approximately one week after initiation, and then once monthly for the next two months to assess for QTc prolongation. Repeat ECG if abnormal. Certain patients may require more frequent and ongoing ECG monitoring [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Manage any abnormalities promptly [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. See Table 1 for dosage modification guidelines for patients who develop an adverse reaction. Table 1. Recommended Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions Adverse Reaction Recommended Action Abbreviations: CPK = creatine phosphokinase, ULN = upper limit of normal. QTc interval prolongation on at least 2 separate electrocardiograms (ECGs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] QTc interval greater than 480 ms to 500 ms Assess electrolyte levels and supplement as clinically indicated. Review and adjust concomitant medications with known QTc interval-prolonging effects [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Monitor ECGs at least weekly for 2 weeks following resolution of QTc prolongation to less than or equal to 480 ms. QTc interval greater than 500 ms Assess electrolyte levels and supplement as clinically indicated. Review and adjust concomitant medications with known QTc interval-prolonging effects [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Interrupt DAURISMO. Resume DAURISMO at a reduced dosage of 50 mg once daily when QTc interval returns to within 30 ms of baseline or less than or equal to 480 ms. Monitor ECGs at least weekly for 2 weeks following resolution of QTc prolongation. Consider re-escalating the dosage of DAURISMO to 100 mg daily if an alternative etiology for the QTc prolongation can be identified. QTc interval prolongation with life-threatening arrhythmia Discontinue DAURISMO permanently. Musculoskeletal adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Grade 3 Grade 1 is mild, Grade 2 is moderate, Grade 3 is severe, Grade 4 is life-threatening. or serum CPK elevation between 2.5 and 10 times upper limit of normal (ULN) Obtain CPK and serum creatinine levels at least weekly until resolution of clinical signs and symptoms. Interrupt DAURISMO until symptoms reduce to mild or return to baseline. Resume DAURISMO at the same dose level, or at a reduced dose of 50 mg. If toxicity recurs, discontinue DAURISMO. Grade 4 or serum CPK elevation greater than 10 times ULN Discontinue DAURISMO. Hematologic toxicity [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Platelets less than 10 Gi/L for more than 42 days in the absence of disease Discontinue DAURISMO and low-dose cytarabine permanently. Neutrophil count less than 0.5 Gi/L for more than 42 days in the absence of disease Discontinue DAURISMO and low-dose cytarabine permanently. Nonhematologic toxicity [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Grade 3 Interrupt DAURISMO and/or low-dose cytarabine until symptoms reduce to mild or return to baseline. Resume DAURISMO at the same dose level, or at a reduced dose of 50 mg. Resume low-dose cytarabine at the same dose level, or at a reduced dose of 15 mg or 10 mg. If toxicity recurs, discontinue DAURISMO and low-dose cytarabine. If toxicity is attributable to DAURISMO only, low-dose cytarabine may be continued. Grade 4 Discontinue DAURISMO and low-dose cytarabine permanently. 2.3 Dosage Modification for Concomitant Use with Moderate CYP3A4 Inducers Avoid concomitant use of DAURISMO with moderate CYP3A4 inducers. If concomitant use of moderate CYP3A4 inducers cannot be avoided, increase the DAURISMO dosage as tolerated as shown in Table 2. After the moderate CYP3A4 inducer has been discontinued for 7 days, resume the DAURISMO dose taken prior to initiating the moderate CYP3A4 inducer [see Drug Interactions (7) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Table 2. Recommended Dosage of DAURISMO with Concomitant Use of Moderate CYP3A4 Inducers Current Dosage Adjusted Dosage 100 mg orally once daily 200 mg orally once daily 50 mg orally once daily 100 mg orally once daily"
