  ],
  "dosage_administration": [
    "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION A small amount of cream should be gently massaged into the affected and surrounding skin areas once or twice daily, except in tinea pedis, where administration should be twice daily. Early relief of symptoms is experienced by the majority of patients and clinical improvement may be seen fairly soon after treatment is begun; however, tinea corporis/cruris and tinea versicolor should be treated for 3 weeks and tinea pedis for 4 weeks to reduce the possibility of recurrence. If significant clinical improvement is not seen after 4 to 6 weeks of treatment, an alternate diagnosis should be considered."
