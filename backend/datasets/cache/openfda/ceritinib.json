    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS CYP3A Inhibitors and Inducers : Avoid concurrent use of ZYKADIA with strong CYP3A inhibitors or inducers. If concurrent use of a strong CYP3A inhibitor is unavoidable, dose reduce ZYKADIA. ( 2.4 , 7.1 ) CYP3A Substrates : Avoid coadministration of ZYKADIA with sensitive CYP3A substrates. ( 7.2 ) CYP2C9 Substrates : Avoid coadministration of ZYKADIA with CYP2C9 substrates for which minimal concentration changes may lead to serious toxicities. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on ZYKADIA Strong CYP3A Inhibitors A strong CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitor (ketoconazole) increased the systemic exposure of ceritinib [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] , which may increase the incidence and severity of adverse reactions of ZYKADIA. Avoid concurrent use of strong CYP3A inhibitors during treatment with ZYKADIA. If concurrent use of strong CYP3A inhibitors is unavoidable, reduce the ZYKADIA dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . Do not consume grapefruit and grapefruit juice as they may inhibit CYP3A. Strong CYP3A Inducers A strong CYP3A4/P-gp inducer (rifampin) decreased the systemic exposure of ceritinib [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] , which may decrease the efficacy of ZYKADIA. Avoid concurrent use of strong CYP3A inducers during treatment with ZYKADIA. 7.2 Effect of ZYKADIA on Other Drugs CYP3A Substrates Ceritinib increased the systemic exposure of a sensitive CYP3A substrate (midazolam) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Avoid coadministration of ZYKADIA with sensitive CYP3A substrates. If concomitant use is unavoidable, consider dose reduction of the sensitive CYP3A substrate(s). If ZYKADIA is coadministered with other CYP3A substrates, refer to the CYP3A substrate labeling for dosage recommendation with strong CYP3A inhibitors. CYP2C9 Substrates Ceritinib increased the systemic exposure of a CYP2C9 substrate (warfarin) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Increase the frequency of INR monitoring if coadministration with warfarin is unavoidable as the anti-coagulant effect of warfarin may be enhanced. Avoid coadministration of ZYKADIA with CYP2C9 substrates for which minimal concentration changes may lead to serious toxicities. If concomitant use of such CYP2C9 substrates is unavoidable, consider dose reduction for the coadministered CYP2C9 substrates. 7.3 Drugs That Prolong QT Interval ZYKADIA causes concentration-dependent increases in the QTc interval. When possible, avoid coadministration of ZYKADIA with other products with a known potential to prolong the QTc interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] . 7.4 Drugs That Cause Bradycardia ZYKADIA can cause bradycardia. When possible, avoid coadministration of ZYKADIA with other products known to cause bradycardia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] ."

    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Interstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] QT Interval Prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Hyperglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Bradycardia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] Pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] The most common adverse reactions (incidence of \u2265 25%) in patients treated with ZYKADIA 450 mg with food are diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, and fatigue; and with ZYKADIA 750 mg under fasted conditions are diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, abdominal pain, decreased appetite, and weight loss. ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation at 1-888-669-6682 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data in the Warnings and Precautions section reflect exposure to ZYKADIA 750 mg once daily under fasted conditions in 925 patients with ALK-positive NSCLC across seven clinical studies, including ASCEND-4 and ASCEND-1, described below, a randomized active-controlled study, two single arm studies, and two dose-escalation studies. The majority of patients enrolled in these studies had received prior treatment with chemotherapy and/or crizotinib for NSCLC. Among these 925 patients, the most common adverse reactions (\u2265 25% incidence) were diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, abdominal pain, decreased appetite, and weight loss. Approximately 45% of patients initiating treatment with ZYKADIA 750 mg under fasted conditions had an adverse reaction that required at least one dose reduction and 66% of patients had an adverse reaction that required at least one dose interruption. The median time to first dose reduction due to any reason was 7 weeks. Dose Optimization Study: Dosing Regimen of 450 mg Daily With Food In ASCEND-8, a dose optimization study, ZYKADIA 450 mg daily with food (N = 108) was compared to 750 mg daily under fasted conditions (N = 110) in both previously treated and untreated patients with ALK-positive NSCLC. The overall safety profile of ZYKADIA 450 mg with food was consistent with ZYKADIA 750 mg fasted, except for a reduction in gastrointestinal adverse reactions, while achieving comparable steady-state exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . The most common adverse reactions (\u2265 25% incidence) in the 450 mg with food arm were diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, and fatigue. The incidence and severity of gastrointestinal adverse reactions (diarrhea 59%, nausea 43%, and vomiting 38%) were reduced for patients treated with ZYKADIA 450 mg with food; Grade \u2265 3 adverse reactions were reported in two patients (1.9%): Grade 3 diarrhea and Grade 3 vomiting in one patient each [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . In patients treated with ZYKADIA 450 mg with food, 24% of patients had an adverse reaction that required at least one dose reduction and 56% of patients had an adverse reaction that required at least one dose interruption. The median time to first dose reduction due to any reason was 8 weeks. Previously Untreated ALK-Positive Metastatic NSCLC The safety of ZYKADIA was evaluated in ASCEND-4, an open-label, randomized, active-controlled multicenter study of 376 previously untreated ALK-positive NSCLC patients [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . Patients received ZYKADIA 750 mg daily (N = 189) under fasted conditions or chemotherapy and maintenance chemotherapy (N = 187). Chemotherapy regimens were pemetrexed (500 mg/m 2 ) and investigator\u2019s choice of cisplatin (75 mg/m 2 ) or carboplatin [area under the curve (AUC) of 5 - 6 mg*min/mL] administered every 21 days. Patients who completed 4 cycles of chemotherapy without progressive disease received pemetrexed (500 mg/m 2 ) as single-agent maintenance therapy every 21 days. The median duration of exposure to ZYKADIA was 18 months. The demographic characteristics of the study population were 57% female, median age 54 years (range, 22 to 81 years), 22% age 65 years or older, 54% white, 42% Asian, 2% black, and 2% other races. Patients were enrolled in Europe (53%), Asia Pacific (42%), and South America (5%) regions. The majority of patients had adenocarcinoma (97%), never smoked (61%), and 32% had brain metastases at screening. The following fatal adverse reactions occurred in 4 patients treated with ZYKADIA: Myocardial infarction, respiratory tract infection, pneumonitis, and unknown cause. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 38% of patients treated with ZYKADIA. The most frequent serious adverse reactions were pneumonia (4%), pleural effusion (4%), vomiting (4%), nausea (3%), dyspnea (3%), hyperglycemia (3%), AST increased (2%), lung infection (2%), and pericardial effusion (2%). Among patients treated with ZYKADIA, dose interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 77%, dose reductions were required in 66%, and adverse reactions that led to discontinuation of therapy occurred in 12% of patients. The most frequent adverse reactions, reported in at least 10% of patients treated with ZYKADIA, that led to dose interruptions or reductions were: Increased ALT (48%), increased AST (34%), vomiting (15%), increased blood creatinine (14%), increased gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) (13%), diarrhea (13%), and nausea (13%). The most frequent adverse reactions that led to discontinuation of ZYKADIA in 1% or more of patients in ASCEND-4 were increased blood creatinine (2.1%), increased amylase (1.1%), and increased lipase (1.1%). Tables 3 and 4 summarize adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities, respectively, in ASCEND-4.

In the chemotherapy arm, one patient had baseline lipase laboratory assessments but no post-baseline assessment; 49 patients had post-baseline assessments. Previously Treated ALK-Positive Metastatic NSCLC The safety of ZYKADIA was evaluated in ASCEND-1, a multicenter, single-arm, open-label clinical study of 255 ALK-positive patients (246 patients with NSCLC and 9 patients with other cancers who received ZYKADIA at a dose of 750 mg daily under fasted conditions) [see Clinical Studies (14.2)] . The median duration of exposure to ZYKADIA was 6 months. The study population characteristics were: Median age 53 years, age less than 65 (84%), female (53%), white (63%), Asian (34%), NSCLC adenocarcinoma histology (90%), never or former smoker (97%), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) 0 or 1 (89%), brain metastases (49%), and number of prior therapies 2 or more (67%). Fatal adverse reactions in patients treated with ZYKADIA occurred in 5% of patients, consisting of: Pneumonia (4 patients), respiratory failure, ILD/pneumonitis, pneumothorax, gastric hemorrhage, general physical health deterioration, pulmonary tuberculosis, cardiac tamponade, and sepsis (1 patient each). Serious adverse reactions reported in 2% or more of patients in ASCEND-1 were convulsion, pneumonia, ILD/pneumonitis, dyspnea, dehydration, hyperglycemia, and nausea. Dose reductions due to adverse reactions occurred in 59% of patients treated with ZYKADIA. The most frequent adverse reactions, reported in at least 10% of patients, that led to dose reductions or interruptions were: Increased ALT (29%), nausea (20%), increased AST (16%), diarrhea (16%), and vomiting (16%). Discontinuation of therapy due to adverse reactions occurred in 10% of patients treated with ZYKADIA. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to discontinuation in 1% or more of patients in ASCEND-1 were pneumonia, ILD/pneumonitis, and decreased appetite.
