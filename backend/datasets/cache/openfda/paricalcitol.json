    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 5 shows the clinically significant drug interactions with Paricalcitol capsules. Table 5: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Paricalcitol CYP3A Inhibitors Clinical Impact Paricalcitol is partially metabolized by CYP3A. Hence, exposure of paricalcitol will increase upon coadministration with strong CYP3A inhibitors such as but not limited to: boceprevir, clarithromycin, conivaptan, grapefruit juice, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir/ritonavir, mibefradil, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, telithromycin, voriconazole. Intervention Dose adjustment of Paricalcitol capsules may be necessary. Monitor closely for iPTH and serum calcium concentrations, if a patient initiates or discontinues therapy with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor. Cholestyramine Clinical Impact Drugs that impair intestinal absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, such as cholestyramine, may interfere with the absorption of paricalcitol. Intervention Recommend to take Paricalcitol capsules at least 1 hour before or 4 to 6 hours after taking cholestyramine (or at as great an interval as possible) to avoid impeding absorption of paricalcitol. Mineral Oil Clinical Impact Mineral oil or other substances that may affect absorption of fat may influence the absorption of paricalcitol. Intervention Recommend to take Paricalcitol capsules at least 1 hour before or 4 to 6 hours after taking mineral oil (or at as great an interval as possible) to avoid affecting absorption of paricalcitol. Strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole) will increase the exposure of paricalcitol. Use with caution (7). Cholestyramine, Mineral Oil: Intestinal absorption of paricalcitol may be reduced if administered simultaneously with cholestyramine or mineral oil. Take paricalcitol capsules at least one hour before or 4 to 6 hours after taking cholestyramine or mineral oil (7)."

    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience CKD Stages 3 and 4 Adults The safety of Paricalcitol Capsules has been evaluated in three 24-week (approximately six-month), double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical studies involving 220 CKD Stages 3 and 4 patients. Six percent (6%) of Paricalcitol Capsules treated patients and 4% of placebo treated patients discontinued from clinical studies due to an adverse event. Adverse events occurring in the Paricalcitol Capsules group at a frequency of 2% or greater and more frequently than in the placebo group are presented in: Table 3. Table 3.

CKD Stage 5 Adults The safety of Paricalcitol Capsules has been evaluated in one 12-week, double-blind, placebo controlled, multicenter clinical study involving 88 CKD Stage 5 patients. Sixty-one patients received Paricalcitol Capsules and 27 patients received placebo. The proportion of patients who terminated prematurely from the study due to adverse events was 7% for Paricalcitol Capsules treated patients and 7% for placebo patients. Adverse events occurring in the Paricalcitol Capsules group at a frequency of 2% or greater and more frequently than in the placebo group are as follows: Table 4.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a casual relationship to drug exposure. Immune System Disorders: Angioedema (including laryngeal edema) Investigations: Blood creatinine increased The most common adverse reactions (> 5% and more frequent than placebo) include diarrhea, nasopharyngitis, dizziness, vomiting, hypertension, hypersensitity, nausea, and edema (6).

    "2 DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION 2.1 Chronic Kidney Disease Stages 3 and 4 in Adults Administer Paricalcitol Capsules orally once daily or three times a week. [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . When dosing three times weekly, do not administer more frequently than every other day. Initial Dose Table 1.

If a further dose reduction is required, the drug should be withheld as needed and restarted at a lower dosing frequency. 2.2 Chronic Kidney Disease Stage 5 in Adults Initial Dose Administer the dose of Paricalcitol Capsules orally three times a week, no more frequently than every other day upon the following formula: Dose (micrograms) = baseline iPTH (pg/mL) divided by 80. Treat patients only after their baseline serum calcium has been adjusted to 9.5 mg/dL or lower to minimize the risk of hypercalcemia [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) and Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Dose Titration Individualize the dose of Paricalcitol Capsules based on iPTH, serum calcium and phosphorus level. Titrate Paricalcitol Capsules dose based on following formula: Dose (micrograms) = most recent iPTH level (pg/ml) divided by 80 If serum calcium is elevated, the dose should be decreased by 2 to 4 micrograms. As iPTH approaches the target range, small, individualized dose adjustments may be necessary in order to achieve a stable iPTH. In situations where monitoring of iPTH, Ca or P occurs less frequently than once per week, a more modest initial and dose titration ratio ((e.g., iPTH divided by 100) may be warranted. Pediatric use information for patients 10 to 16 years of age is approved for AbbVie Inc.\u2019s Zemplar (Paricalcitol) capsules. However, due to AbbVie Inc.\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. 2.4 Monitoring Monitor serum calcium and phosphorus levels closely after initiation of Paricalcitol Capsules during dose titration periods and during co-administration with strong CYP3A inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Drug Interactions (7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. If hypercalcemia is observed, the dose of Paricalcitol Capsules should be reduced or withheld until these parameters are normalized. 2.5 Administration Paricalcitol Capsules may be taken without regard to food.

Administer dose orally three times a week*. Dose Titration: CKD Stage 5 (2.2) Adult Dose in micrograms is based on most recent iPTH (pg/mL) divided by 80 with adjustments based on serum calcium and phosphorous levels.
