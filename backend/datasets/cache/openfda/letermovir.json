    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Dosage Adjustment: If PREVYMIS is co-administered with cyclosporine, the dosage of PREVYMIS should be decreased to 240 mg once daily in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. ( 2.4 ) If PREVYMIS is co-administered with cyclosporine in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age, dose adjustment may be required. ( 2.6 ) Co-administration of PREVYMIS may alter the plasma concentrations of other drugs and other drugs may alter the plasma concentrations of PREVYMIS. Consult the full prescribing information prior to and during treatment for potential drug interactions. ( 2.4 , 2.6 , 4 , 5.1 , 7.1 , 7.2 , 7.3 , 7.4 , 12.3 ) 7.1 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect PREVYMIS Letermovir is a substrate of organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1/3 (OATP1B1/3) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transporters and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1/3 (UGT1A1/3) enzymes. Co-administration of PREVYMIS with drugs that are inhibitors of OATP1B1/3 transporters may result in increases in letermovir plasma concentrations (Table 11). Co-administration of PREVYMIS with inducers of transporters (e.g., P-gp) and/or enzymes (e.g., UGTs) is not recommended due to the potential for a decrease in letermovir plasma concentrations (see Table 11 ) . 7.2 Potential for PREVYMIS to Affect Other Drugs Co-administration of PREVYMIS with midazolam results in increased midazolam plasma concentrations, indicating that letermovir is a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Co-administration of PREVYMIS with drugs that are CYP3A substrates may result in clinically relevant increases in the plasma concentrations of co-administered CYP3A substrates (Table 11) [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Letermovir is an inhibitor of OATP1B1/3 transporters. Co-administration of PREVYMIS with drugs that are substrates of OATP1B1/3 transporters may result in a clinically relevant increase in plasma concentrations of co-administered OATP1B1/3 substrates (Table 11). The magnitude of CYP3A- and OATP1B1/3-mediated drug interactions on co-administered drugs may be different when PREVYMIS is co-administered with cyclosporine. See the prescribing information for cyclosporine for information on drug interactions with cyclosporine. 7.3 Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions If dose adjustments of concomitant medications are made due to treatment with PREVYMIS, doses should be readjusted after treatment with PREVYMIS is completed. Table 11 provides a listing of established or potentially clinically significant drug interactions. The drug interactions described are based on adult studies conducted with PREVYMIS or are predicted drug interactions that may occur with PREVYMIS [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .

    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Adult HSCT Patients: Most common adverse events (occurring in at least 10% of subjects in the PREVYMIS group and at a frequency at least 2% greater than placebo) are nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, peripheral edema, cough, headache, fatigue, and abdominal pain. ( 6.1 ) Adult Kidney Transplant Patients: Most common adverse event (occurring in at least 10% of subjects in the PREVYMIS group and at a frequency greater than valganciclovir) is diarrhea. ( 6.1 ) Pediatric Patients: Adverse events in pediatric patients are similar to adults. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC at 1-877-888-4231 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adult CMV-seropositive Recipients [R+] of an Allogeneic HSCT Prophylaxis Through Week 14 (~100 days) Post-HSCT The safety of PREVYMIS was evaluated in a Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (P001) in which 565 subjects were randomized and treated with PREVYMIS (N=373) or placebo (N=192) through Week 14 post-HSCT. Adverse events were those reported while subjects were on study medication or within two weeks of study medication completion/discontinuation. The mean time for reporting adverse events and laboratory abnormalities was approximately 22% longer in the PREVYMIS arm compared to the placebo arm. Cardiac Adverse Events The cardiac adverse event rate was higher in subjects receiving PREVYMIS (13%) compared to subjects receiving placebo (6%). The most common cardiac adverse events were tachycardia (reported in 4% of PREVYMIS subjects and in 2% of placebo subjects) and atrial fibrillation (reported in 3% of PREVYMIS subjects and in 1% of placebo subjects). Among those subjects who experienced one or more cardiac adverse events, 85% of PREVYMIS and 92% of placebo subjects had events reported as mild or moderate in severity. Common Adverse Events The rate of adverse events occurring in at least 10% of subjects in the PREVYMIS group and at a frequency at least 2% greater than placebo are outlined in Table 8. Table 8: Trial P001 All Grade Adverse Events Reported in \u2265 10% of PREVYMIS-Treated HSCT Recipients at a Frequency at least 2% Greater than Placebo Adverse Events PREVYMIS (N=373) Placebo (N=192) nausea 27% 23% diarrhea 26% 24% vomiting 19% 14% peripheral edema 14% 9% cough 14% 10% headache 14% 9% fatigue 13% 11% abdominal pain 12% 9% Overall, similar proportions of subjects in each group discontinued study medication due to an adverse event (13% of PREVYMIS subjects vs. 12% of placebo subjects). The most frequently reported adverse event that led to study drug discontinuation was nausea, occurring in 2% of PREVYMIS subjects and 1% of placebo subjects. Hypersensitivity reaction, with associated moderate dyspnea, occurred in one subject following the first infusion of IV PREVYMIS after switching from oral PREVYMIS, leading to treatment discontinuation. Laboratory Abnormalities Selected laboratory abnormalities reported during treatment or within 2 weeks of stopping treatment are presented in Table 9.

Prophylaxis From Week 14 (~100 days) Through Week 28 (~200 days) Post-HSCT The safety of PREVYMIS was evaluated in a Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (P040) in which 218 subjects who completed PREVYMIS prophylaxis through ~100 days post-HSCT were randomized to treatment with PREVYMIS (N=144) or placebo (N=74) through Week 28 (~200 days) post-HSCT. Adverse events were those reported while subjects were on study drug or within two weeks of study drug completion/discontinuation. The most commonly reported adverse events in P040 were similar to those reported in P001. Study drug was discontinued due to an adverse event in 5% of PREVYMIS subjects and 1% of placebo subjects. The cardiac adverse event rate was 4% in the PREVYMIS and placebo groups. The rates of hematologic laboratory abnormalities were comparable in the PREVYMIS and placebo groups. Serum creatinine abnormalities > 1.5 mg/dL occurred in 15% of PREVYMIS and 8% of placebo subjects. Adult Kidney Transplant Recipients [D+/R-] The safety of PREVYMIS was evaluated in a Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, active comparator-controlled trial (P002) in which 589 subjects were treated with PREVYMIS (N=292) or valganciclovir (N=297) through Week 28 post-transplant. Adverse events were those reported while subjects were on study medication or within two weeks of study medication completion/discontinuation. In these subjects, diarrhea was reported in at least 10% of subjects in the PREVYMIS group and at a frequency greater than valganciclovir (PREVYMIS, 32%; valganciclovir, 29%). Study drug was discontinued due to an adverse event in 4% of PREVYMIS subjects and 14% of valganciclovir subjects. The most frequently reported adverse events that led to study drug discontinuation were neutropenia (PREVYMIS, 1%; valganciclovir, 2%) and leukopenia (PREVYMIS, 1%; valganciclovir, 5%).

There are insufficient data in adult patients with CLcr 10 mL/min or less or in patients on dialysis or in pediatric patients with a similar degree of renal impairment (based on age-appropriate assessment of renal function) to make PREVYMIS dosing recommendations. In adult patients with CLcr less than 50 mL/min and in pediatric patients with a similar degree of renal impairment (based on age-appropriate assessment of renal function) receiving PREVYMIS injection, accumulation of the intravenous vehicle, hydroxypropyl betadex, may occur. Closely monitor serum creatinine levels in these patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . 2.8 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment No dosage adjustment of PREVYMIS is required for patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment. PREVYMIS is not recommended for patients with severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . 2.9 Preparation and Administration of Oral Pellets PREVYMIS oral pellets can be administered: orally after mixing with soft food or via NG tube or G tube. Preparation and Administration Mixed with Soft Food See Instructions for Use for details on the preparation and administration of PREVYMIS oral pellets mixed with soft food. Do not crush or chew PREVYMIS oral pellets. Mix PREVYMIS oral pellets with 1 to 3 teaspoons of soft food (such as applesauce, yogurt, or pudding) that is at or below room temperature. Do not use hot food. Administer entire mixture within 10 minutes of mixing PREVYMIS oral pellets with the soft food. Preparation and Administration via NG Tube or G Tube See Instructions for Use , Table 4 (NG tube) and Table 5 (G tube) for details on the preparation and administration of PREVYMIS oral pellets via NG tube or G tube. Pour PREVYMIS oral pellets into a medicine cup containing room temperature water (see Initial Volume in Table 4 and Table 5). Do not mix PREVYMIS oral pellets with hot or cold (refrigerated) water. Wait 10 minutes. Do not shake or swirl the medicine cup. PREVYMIS oral pellets will not dissolve but will become loose or broken up. The entire mixture should be administered (see steps 3 and 4) within 2 hours. Stir the mixture with the syringe and administer entire mixture right away using the syringe and NG tube or G tube. Add room temperature water (see Rinse Volume in Table 4 and Table 5) to the medicine cup for rinsing, stir with a syringe and administer the entire rinse mixture using the syringe and NG tube or G tube. Flush the NG tube or G tube with the volume of water recommended by the NG or G tube manufacturer.
