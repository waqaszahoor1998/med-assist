    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors: Maximum recommended dosage is 80 mg once daily ( 7 ). 7.1 Drugs Having Clinically Important Interactions with Levomilnacipran Table 5 includes clinically important drug interactions with levomilnacipran. Table 5: Clinically Important Drug Interactions with Levomilnacipran Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of SSRIs and SNRIs including levomilnacipran with MAOIs increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. Intervention: Concomitant use of levomilnacipran is contraindicated: \u00b7 With an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders or within 7 days of stopping treatment with levomilnacipran. \u00b7 Within 14 days of stopping an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders \u00b7 In a patient who is being treated with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 , 2.6 ), Contraindications ( 4 ) , and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] . Examples: selegiline, tranylcypromine, isocarboxazid, phenelzine, linezolid, methylene blue Other Serotonergic Drugs Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of levomilnacipran with other serotonergic drugs increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. Intervention: Monitor for symptoms of serotonin syndrome when levomilnacipran is used concomitantly with other drugs that may affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems. If serotonin syndrome occurs, immediately discontinue levomilnacipran and/or concomitant serotonergic drugs [see Dosage and Administration (2.5 , 2.6 ), Contraindications (4) , and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Examples: other SNRIs, SSRIs, triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, buspirone, amphetamines, tryptophan, and St. John's Wort Drugs that Interfere with Hemostasis Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of levomilnacipran with an antiplatelet or anticoagulant drug may potentiate the risk of bleeding. This may be due to the effect of levomilnacipran on the release of serotonin by platelets. Intervention: Closely monitor for bleeding for patients receiving an antiplatelet or anticoagulant drug when levomilnacipran is initiated or discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) ] . Examples: NSAIDs, aspirin, and warfarin Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of levomilnacipran with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors increases levomilnacipran exposure [see Pharmacokinetics ( 12.3 ) ] . Intervention: The dose of levomilnacipran should not exceed 80 mg once daily when used with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ) ]. Examples: Ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin Alcohol Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of levomilnacipran and alcohol may result in accelerated release of levomilnacipran. Intervention: Avoid concomitant use of levomilnacipran and alcohol [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] ."

    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label. Hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4) ] Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Adolescents and Young Adults [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Serotonin Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Elevated Blood Pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Elevated Heart Rate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Increased Risk of Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Angle Closure Glaucoma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Urinary Hesitation or Retention [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7 )] Activation of Mania/Hypomania [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Seizure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Discontinuation Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] Hyponatremia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] Sexual Dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] The most common adverse reactions (incidence \u2265 5% and at least twice the rate of placebo) are: nausea, constipation, hyperhidrosis, heart rate increase, erectile dysfunction, ejaculation disorder, tachycardia, vomiting, and palpitations ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Amneal Pharmaceuticals at 1-877-835-5472 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Patient exposure The safety of levomilnacipran was evaluated in 3,317 patients (18 to 78 years of age) diagnosed with MDD who participated in clinical studies, representing 1,186 patient-years of exposure. Among the 3,317 levomilnacipran-treated patients, 1,583 were exposed to levomilnacipran in short-term, placebo-controlled studies. There were 825 patients who continued from short-term studies into a one-year, open-label extension study. Of the 3,317 patients exposed to at least one dose of levomilnacipran, 895 patients were exposed to levomilnacipran for at least 6 months and 367 were exposed for one year. In these studies, levomilnacipran was given at doses ranging from 40 mg to 120 mg once daily and was given without regard to food. Adverse reactions reported as reasons for discontinuation of treatment In the short-term placebo-controlled pre-marketing studies for MDD, 9% of the 1,583 patients who received levomilnacipran (40 mg to 120 mg) discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction, compared with 3% of the 1,040 placebo-treated patients in those studies. The most common adverse reaction leading to discontinuation in at least 1% of the levomilnacipran-treated patients in the short-term placebo-controlled studies was nausea (1.5%). Common adverse reactions in placebo-controlled MDD studies The most commonly observed adverse reactions in levomilnacipran-treated MDD patients in placebo-controlled studies (incidence \u2265 5% and at least twice the rate of placebo) were: nausea, constipation, hyperhidrosis, heart rate increased, erectile dysfunction, ejaculation disorder, tachycardia, vomiting, and palpitations. Table 3 shows the incidence of adverse reactions that occurred in \u2265 2% of levomilnacipran-treated MDD patients and at least twice the rate of placebo in the placebo-controlled studies.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
