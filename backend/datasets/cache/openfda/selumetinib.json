    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022 Strong or Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitors or Fluconazole : Avoid coadministration of strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors or fluconazole with KOSELUGO. If coadministration cannot be avoided, reduce the dose of KOSELUGO. ( 2.5 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Strong or Moderate CYP3A4 Inducers : Avoid concomitant use of strong and moderate CYP3A4 inducers. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on KOSELUGO Strong or Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitors or Fluconazole Clinical Impact \u2022 Concomitant use of KOSELUGO with a strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor or fluconazole increased selumetinib plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] , which may increase the risk of adverse reactions. Management \u2022 Avoid coadministration of strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors or fluconazole with KOSELUGO. If coadministration with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors or fluconazole cannot be avoided, reduce KOSELUGO dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. Strong or Moderate CYP3A4 Inducers Clinical Impact \u2022 Concomitant use of KOSELUGO with a strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducer decreased selumetinib plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] , which may reduce KOSELUGO efficacy. Management \u2022 Avoid concomitant use of strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers with KOSELUGO. Vitamin E Clinical Impact \u2022 KOSELUGO capsules contain vitamin E and daily vitamin E intake that exceeds the recommended or safe limits may increase the risk of bleeding. An increased risk of bleeding may occur in patients taking a vitamin-K antagonist or an anti-platelet agent with KOSELUGO capsules. Management \u2022 Supplemental vitamin E is not recommended if daily vitamin E intake (including the amount of vitamin E in KOSELUGO capsules and supplement) will exceed the recommended or safe limits. \u2022 Monitor for bleeding in patients co-administered a vitamin-K antagonist or an anti-platelet agent with KOSELUGO capsules. Increase INR monitoring, as appropriate, in patients taking a vitamin-K antagonist [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] ."

    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: \u2022 Cardiomyopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] \u2022 Ocular toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] \u2022 Gastrointestinal toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] \u2022 Skin toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] \u2022 Increased creatine phosphokinase [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Most common adverse reactions (\u2265 40%) are: vomiting, diarrhea, increased creatine phosphokinase, dry skin, paronychia, nausea, dermatitis acneiform, and pyrexia. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact AstraZeneca at 1-800-236-9933 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflect exposure to KOSELUGO in 134 pediatric patients at the recommended dose in SPRINKLE (N = 36) (NCT05309668), in SPRINT Phase I (N = 24), SPRINT Phase II Stratum 1 (N = 50), and Phase I Food Effect Study (N = 24). Among the 134 pediatric patients, the duration of KOSELUGO exposure, including dose interruptions, was 12 months or longer (80%), more than 2 years (44%), or more than 3 years (37%). In this pooled safety population, the most common adverse reactions of any grade (incidence \u2265 40%) were vomiting (64%), diarrhea (59%), increased creatine phosphokinase (55%), dry skin (51%), paronychia (50%), nausea (49%), dermatitis acneiform (47%), and pyrexia (46%). Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) with Inoperable Plexiform Neurofibromas (PN) Pediatrics 2 18 years of Age (SPRINT Phase II Stratum 1) The safety of KOSELUGO was evaluated in SPRINT Phase II Stratum 1 [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Eligible patients were 2-18 years of age with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) who had inoperable plexiform neurofibromas (PN) that was causing significant morbidity. Patients were excluded for abnormal LVEF, uncontrolled hypertension (blood pressure > the 95 th percentile for age, height, and sex), any current or past history of RVO or RPED, intraocular pressure > 21 mmHg (or upper limit of normal adjusted by age), uncontrolled glaucoma, and inability to swallow whole capsules. Patients received KOSELUGO 25 mg/m 2 orally twice daily (n=50). Among these patients, 88% were exposed for 12 months or longer and 66% were exposed for greater than 2 years. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 24% of patients who received KOSELUGO. Serious adverse reactions that occurred in 2 or more patients were anemia, hypoxia and diarrhea. Permanent discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 12% of patients who received KOSELUGO. Adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of KOSELUGO included increased blood creatinine, increased weight, diarrhea, paronychia, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, acute kidney injury, and skin ulcer. Dosage interruptions and dose reductions due to adverse reactions occurred in 80% and 24% of patients who received KOSELUGO, respectively. Adverse reactions requiring a dosage interruption or reduction in \u2265 5% of patients were vomiting, paronychia, diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, skin infection, influenza like illness, pyrexia and weight gain. The most common adverse reactions (\u2265 40%) were vomiting, rash (all), abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, dry skin, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, pyrexia, acneiform rash, stomatitis, headache, paronychia, and pruritus. Table 10 presents the adverse reactions in SPRINT Phase II Stratum 1.

The study evaluated the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, efficacy, and tolerability of KOSELUGO oral granules. Study patients were to receive KOSELUGO oral granules for 25 cycles at a dose equivalent to 25 mg/m 2 BSA twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The median age was approximately 4 years (range: 1 to 7 years), 61% were male, 61% were White, 14% were Asian and 3% were Black or African American. In the SPRINKLE study, the median duration of KOSELUGO oral granules treatment in pediatric patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) plexiform neurofibromas (PN) was 11 months (range: 3 25 months). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 6% of patients who received KOSELUGO oral granules. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 1 patient each and included pyrexia, gastroenteritis and upper respiratory infection. A total of 31% of patients had an adverse reaction leading to a dosage interruption. Adverse reactions requiring a dosage interruption in \u2265 5% of patients were pyrexia, vomiting, diarrhea, upper respiratory infection, gastroenteritis and eczema. The most common adverse reactions (\u2265 40%) were pyrexia, dry skin, and paronychia. The observed safety profile of KOSELUGO oral granules in the SPRINKLE study was consistent with the known safety profile of KOSELUGO capsules."
