    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022 Strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors: Avoid coadministration. If unavoidable, reduce BRAFTOVI dosage. ( 2.6 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Strong CYP3A4 inducers: Avoid coadministration. ( 7.1 ) \u2022 Sensitive CYP3A4 substrates: Avoid coadministration with CYP3A4 substrates (including hormonal contraceptives) for which a decrease in plasma concentration may lead to reduced efficacy of the substrate. ( 7.2 ) \u2022 Transporters: Dose reductions of drugs that are substrates of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, or BCRP may be required when used concomitantly with BRAFTOVI. ( 7.2 , 12.3 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on BRAFTOVI Strong or Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitors Coadministration of BRAFTOVI with a strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor increases encorafenib plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] and may increase encorafenib adverse reactions. Avoid coadministration of BRAFTOVI with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors, including grapefruit juice. If coadministration is unavoidable, reduce the BRAFTOVI dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Coadministration of BRAFTOVI with a strong CYP3A4 inducer may decrease encorafenib plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] and may decrease encorafenib efficacy. Avoid coadministration of BRAFTOVI with strong CYP3A4 inducers. 7.2 Effect of BRAFTOVI on Other Drugs Sensitive CYP3A4 Substrates BRAFTOVI is a strong CYP3A4 inducer at steady-state. Concomitant use of BRAFTOVI may decrease the plasma concentrations of CYP3A4 substrates (including hormonal contraceptives), [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] , which may reduce the efficacy of these substrates. Avoid the coadministration of BRAFTOVI with CYP3A4 substrates for which a decrease in plasma concentration may lead to reduced efficacy of the substrate. If the coadministration cannot be avoided, see the CYP3A4 substrate product labeling for recommendations. OATP1B1, OATP1B3, or BCRP Substrates Coadministration of BRAFTOVI with OATP1B1, OATP1B3, or BCRP substrates can result in increased concentrations of the substrates, and may increase toxicity of these agents. When used in combination, monitor patients closely for signs and symptoms of increased exposure and consider adjusting the dose of these substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.3 Drugs That Prolong the QT Interval BRAFTOVI is associated with dose-dependent QTc interval prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] . Avoid coadministration of BRAFTOVI with drugs known to prolong the QT/QTc interval."

BRAF V600E or V600K Mutation-Positive Unresectable or Metastatic Melanoma The safety of BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib is described in 192 patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma who received BRAFTOVI (450 mg once daily) in combination with binimetinib (45 mg twice daily) in a randomized open-label, active-controlled trial (COLUMBUS). The COLUMBUS trial [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] excluded patients with a history of Gilbert's syndrome, abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction, prolonged QTc (>480 ms), uncontrolled hypertension, and history or current evidence of retinal vein occlusion. The median duration of exposure was 11.8 months for patients treated with BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib and 6.2 months for patients treated with vemurafenib. The most common (\u226525%) adverse reactions in patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib were fatigue, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and arthralgia. Adverse reactions leading to dose interruptions of BRAFTOVI occurred in 30% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib; the most common were nausea (7%), vomiting (7%), and pyrexia (4%). Adverse reactions leading to dose reductions of BRAFTOVI occurred in 14% of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib; the most common were arthralgia (2%), fatigue (2%), and nausea (2%). Five percent (5%) of patients receiving BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib experienced an adverse reaction that resulted in permanent discontinuation of BRAFTOVI; the most common were hemorrhage in 2% and headache in 1% of patients. Table 5 and Table 6 present adverse drug reactions and laboratory abnormalities, respectively, identified in COLUMBUS. The COLUMBUS trial was not designed to demonstrate a statistically significant difference in adverse reaction rates for BRAFTOVI in combination with binimetinib, as compared to vemurafenib, for any specific adverse reaction listed in Table 5.

Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] \u2022 Grade 2 AST or ALT increased Maintain BRAFTOVI dose. \u2022 If no improvement within 4 weeks, withhold BRAFTOVI until improves to Grade 0-1 or to pretreatment/baseline levels and then resume at same dose. \u2022 Grade 3 or 4 AST or ALT increased See Other Adverse Reactions . Uveitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] \u2022 Grade 1\u20133 If Grade 1 or 2 does not respond to specific ocular therapy, or for Grade 3 uveitis, withhold BRAFTOVI for up to 6 weeks. \u2022 If improved, resume at same or reduced dose. \u2022 If not improved, permanently discontinue BRAFTOVI. \u2022 Grade 4 Permanently discontinue BRAFTOVI. QTc Prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] \u2022 QTcF greater than 500 ms and less than or equal to 60 ms increase from baseline Withhold BRAFTOVI until QTcF less than or equal to 500 ms. Resume at reduced dose. \u2022 If more than one recurrence, permanently discontinue BRAFTOVI. \u2022 QTcF greater than 500 ms and greater than 60 ms increase from baseline Permanently discontinue BRAFTOVI. Dermatologic [other than Hand-foot Skin Reaction (HFSR)] [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] \u2022 Grade 2 If no improvement within 2 weeks, withhold BRAFTOVI until Grade 0\u20131. Resume at same dose. \u2022 Grade 3 Withhold BRAFTOVI until Grade 0\u20131. Resume at same dose if first occurrence or reduce dose if recurrent. \u2022 Grade 4 Permanently discontinue BRAFTOVI. Other Adverse Reactions (including Hemorrhage) [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ] and HFSR [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] Dose modification of BRAFTOVI when administered with binimetinib or with cetuximab is not recommended for new primary cutaneous malignancies; ocular events other than uveitis, iritis, and iridocyclitis; interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis; creatine phosphokinase (CPK) elevation; rhabdomyolysis; and venous thromboembolism. \u2022 Recurrent Grade 2 or \u2022 First occurrence of any Grade 3 Withhold BRAFTOVI for up to 4 weeks. \u2022 If improves to Grade 0\u20131 or to pretreatment/baseline level, resume at reduced dose. \u2022 If no improvement, permanently discontinue BRAFTOVI. \u2022 First occurrence of any Grade 4 Permanently discontinue BRAFTOVI or Withhold BRAFTOVI for up to 4 weeks. \u2022 If improves to Grade 0\u20131 or to pretreatment/baseline level, then resume at reduced dose. \u2022 If no improvement, permanently discontinue BRAFTOVI. \u2022 Recurrent Grade 3 Consider permanently discontinuing BRAFTOVI. \u2022 Recurrent Grade 4 Permanently discontinue BRAFTOVI. Refer to the binimetinib or cetuximab prescribing information for dose modifications for adverse reactions associated with each product, as appropriate. 2.6 Dose Modifications for Coadministration with Strong or Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitors Avoid coadministration of BRAFTOVI with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors. If coadministration is unavoidable, reduce the BRAFTOVI dose according to the recommendations in Table 4. After the inhibitor has been discontinued for 3 to 5 elimination half-lives, resume the BRAFTOVI dose that was taken prior to initiating the CYP3A4 inhibitor [see Drug Interactions (7.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Table 4: Recommended Dose Reductions for BRAFTOVI for Coadministration with Strong or Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitors Current Daily Dose Current daily dose refers to recommended dose of BRAFTOVI based on indication or reductions for adverse reactions based on dosing recommendations in Table 1 (Melanoma) and Table 2 (CRC). Dose for Coadministration with Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitor Dose for Coadministration with Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitor 450 mg 225 mg (three 75 mg capsules) 150 mg (two 75 mg capsules) 300 mg 150 mg (two 75 mg capsules) 75 mg 225 mg 75 mg 75 mg 150 mg 75 mg 75 mg Encorafenib exposure at the 75 mg QD BRAFTOVI dosage when coadministered with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is expected to be higher than at the 150 mg QD dosage in the absence of a CYP3A4 inhibitor and similar to exposure at the 225 mg QD dosage in the absence of a CYP3A4 inhibitor. Monitor patients closely for adverse reactions and use clinical judgement when using BRAFTOVI with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors at the 150 mg dose level."
