Multiple Myeloma XPOVIO in Combination with Bortezomib and Dexamethasone (XVd) The safety of XPOVIO in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone was evaluated in BOSTON [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )]. Patients were randomized to receive XPOVIO 100 mg orally once weekly in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone (XVd) (n=195) or bortezomib and dexamethasone (Vd) (n=204). Among patients who received XPOVIO, the median duration of XPOVIO treatment was 29 weeks (range: 1 to 120 weeks) and the median dose was 80 mg (range: 30 to 137 mg) per week. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 52% of patients who received XPOVIO in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone. Serious adverse reactions in >3% of patients included pneumonia (14%), sepsis, diarrhea and vomiting (4% each). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 6% of patients within 30 days of last treatment, including pneumonia (n=3) and sepsis (n=3). Grade \u22652 peripheral neuropathy, a pre-specified key secondary endpoint, was lower in the XVd arm (21%) compared to the Vd arm (34%); odds ratio 0.50 [95% CI: 0.32, 0.79]. The median treatment duration was 30 weeks (range: 1-120 weeks) in patients who received once weekly XVd as compared to 32 weeks (range: 1-122 weeks) in patients who received twice weekly Vd. Permanent discontinuation of XPOVIO due to an adverse reaction occurred in 19% of patients. Adverse reactions which resulted in permanent discontinuation of XPOVIO in >2% of patients included fatigue (3.6%), nausea (3.1%), thrombocytopenia, decreased appetite, peripheral neuropathy, and vomiting (2.1% each). Dosage interruptions of XPOVIO due to an adverse reaction occurred in 83% of patients. Adverse reactions which required dosage interruption in >5% of patients included thrombocytopenia (33%), fatigue (13%), asthenia (12%), pneumonia (11%), upper respiratory tract infection (10%), decreased appetite (9%), neutropenia (8%), pyrexia (8%), nausea (7%), bronchitis (7%), diarrhea (6%), weight decreased (6%), and anemia (5%). Dose reductions of XPOVIO due to an adverse reaction occurred in 64% of patients. Adverse reactions which required dose reductions in >5% of patients included thrombocytopenia (31%), decreased appetite (8%), nausea, fatigue, weight decreased (7% each), and asthenia (6%). The most common adverse reactions (\u226520% with a difference between arms of >5% compared to Vd) were fatigue, nausea, decreased appetite, diarrhea, peripheral neuropathy, upper respiratory tract infection, weight decreased, cataract, and vomiting. Grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities (\u226510%) were thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, hypophosphatemia, anemia, hyponatremia, and neutropenia. Table 5 summarizes the adverse reactions in BOSTON.
