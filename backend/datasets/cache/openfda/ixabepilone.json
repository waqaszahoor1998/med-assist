    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Avoid strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. If coadministration cannot be avoided, reduce the dosage of IXEMPRA ( 2.5 , 7.1 ). Strong CYP3A4 Inducers: Avoid strong CYP3A4 inducers. If coadministration cannot be avoided, reduce the dosage of IXEMPRA ( 2.5 , 7.1 ). 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on IXEMPRA Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors The coadministration of IXEMPRA with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor increased ixabepilone plasma concentration, which may increase the incidence and severity of adverse reactions of IXEMPRA. Avoid coadministration of IXEMPRA with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. If the coadministration of IXEMPRA with strong CYP3A4 cannot be avoided, reduce the dose of IXEMPRA [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ]. Moderate or Weak CYP3A4 Inhibitors The coadministration of IXEMPRA with moderate or weak CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase the incidence and severity of adverse reactions of IXEMPRA. Monitor for adverse reactions and reduce the dose of IXEMPRA as recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6 )]. Strong CYP3A4 Inducers The coadministration of IXEMPRA with a strong CYP3A4 inducer, decreased plasma concentrations of ixabepilone, which may decrease the efficacy of IXEMPRA [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Avoid the coadministration IXEMPRA with strong CYP3A4 inducers. If the coadministration of IXEMPRA with a strong CYP3A4 inducer cannot be avoided, increase the dose of IXEMPRA [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )]. Concomitant Use of IXEMPRA and Capecitabine No clinically meaningful differences in the pharmacokinetics of ixabepilone and capecitabine were observed when IXEMPRA was administered in combination with capecitabine (1000 mg/m 2 ) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.2 Effect of Ixabepilone on Other Drugs Ixabepilone does not inhibit CYP enzymes at relevant clinical concentrations and is not expected to alter the plasma concentrations of other drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.3 Capecitabine In patients with cancer who received ixabepilone (40 mg/m 2 ) in combination with capecitabine (1000 mg/m 2 ), ixabepilone Cmax decreased by 19%, capecitabine Cmax decreased by 27%, and 5-fluorouracil AUC increased by 14%, as compared to ixabepilone or capecitabine administered separately. The interaction is not clinically significant given that the combination treatment is supported by efficacy data."

Unless otherwise specified, assessment of adverse reactions is based on one randomized study (Study 046) and one single-arm study (Study 081). In Study 046, 369 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with IXEMPRA 40 mg/m 2 administered intravenously over 3 hours every 21 days, combined with capecitabine 1000 mg/m 2 twice daily for 2 weeks followed by a 1-week rest period. Patients treated with capecitabine as a single agent (n=368) in this study received 1250 mg/m twice daily for 2 weeks every 21 days. In Study 081, 126 patients with metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer were treated with IXEMPRA 40 mg/m 2 administered intravenously over 3 hours every 3 weeks. The most common adverse reactions (\u226520%) reported by patients receiving IXEMPRA were peripheral sensory neuropathy, fatigue/asthenia, myalgia/arthralgia, alopecia, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis/mucositis, diarrhea, and musculo\u00adskeletal pain. The following additional reactions occurred in \u226520% in combination treatment: palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (hand-foot) syndrome, anorexia, abdominal pain, nail disorder, and constipation. The most common hematologic abnormalities (>40%) include neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Table 4 presents nonhematologic adverse reactions reported in 5% or more of patients.

If coadministration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor with IXEMPRA cannot be avoided, reduce the dose of IXEMPRA to 20 mg/m 2 . If the strong inhibitor is discontinued, increase the IXEMPRA dose (at 1 week after discontinuing the inhibitor) to that was used before starting the strong inhibitor [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Avoid the concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers. If coadministration of a strong CYP3A4 inducer with IXEMPRA cannot be avoided, gradually increase the dose from 40 mg/m2 to 60 mg/m 2 as tolerated once a patient has been maintained on a strong CYP3A4 inducer. Administer IXEMPRA as a 4-hour intravenous infusion and monitor patients carefully for adverse reactions. If the strong inducer is discontinued, reduce the IXEMPRA dose to that before that before starting the strong CYP3A4 inducer [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 2.6 Preparation and Administration IXEMPRA is a hazardous drug. Follow aplicable special handling and disposal procedures. 1 IXEMPRA Kit contains two vials, a vial labeled IXEMPRA (ixabepilone) for injection which contains ixabepilone powder and a vial containing DILUENT for IXEMPRA. Use only the supplied DILUENT to reconstitute IXEMPRA (ixabepilone) for injection. Reconstituation 1. Prior to reconstituting, remove the IXEMPRA Kit from the refrigerator and allow it to stand at room temperature for approximately 30 minutes. When the vials are first removed from the refrigerator, a white precipitate may be observed in the DILUENT vial. This precipitate will dissolve to form a clear solution once the DILUENT warms to room temperature. 2. With a suitable syringe, aseptically withdraw the DILUENT and slowly inject it into the IXEMPRA for injection vial. The 15-mg IXEMPRA is reconstituted with 8 mL of DILUENT and the 45-mg IXEMPRA is reconstituted with 23.5 mL of DILUENT. 3. Gently swirl and invert the vial until the powder in IXEMPRA is completely dissolved. 4. After reconstituting with the DILUENT, the concentration of ixabepilone is 2 mg/mL. 5. After reconstituting IXEMPRA, dilute the reconstituted with infusion fluid as soon as possible. The reconstituted solution may be stored in the vial (not the syringe) for a maximum of 1 hour at room temperature and room light. Dilution Before administration, the reconstituted solution must be further diluted with one of the specified infusion fluids listed below. Other infusion fluids should not be used with IXEMPRA. The IXEMPRA infusion must be prepared in a DEHP [di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate] free bag. The following infusion fluids have been qualified for use in the dilution of IXEMPRA: Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection, USP 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (pH adjusted with Sodium Bicarbonate Injection, USP) When using a 250 mL or a 500 mL bag of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection to prepare the infusion, the pH must be adjusted to a pH between 6.0 and 9.0 by adding 2 mEq (ie, 2 mL of an 8.4% w/v solution or 4 mL of a 4.2% w/v solution) of Sodium Bicarbonate Injection, prior to the addition of the reconstituted IXEMPRA solution. PLASMA-LYTE A Injection pH 7.4 \u00ae For most doses, a 250 mL bag of infusion fluid is sufficient. However, it is necessary to check the final IXEMPRA infusion concentration of each dose based on the volume of infusion fluid to be used. The final concentration for infusion must be between 0.2 mg/mL and 0.6 mg/mL. To calculate the final infusion concentration, use the following formulas: Total Infusion Volume = mL of Reconstituted Solution + mL of infusion fluid Final Infusion Concentration = Dose of IXEMPRA (mg)/Total Infusion Volume (mL) 1. Aseptically, withdraw the appropriate volume of reconstituted solution containing 2 mg of ixabepilone per mL. 2. Aseptically, transfer to an intravenous bag containing an appropriate volume of infusion fluid to achieve the final desired concentration of IXEMPRA. 3. Thoroughly mix the infusion bag by manual rotation. 4. Once diluted with infusion fluid, the solution is stable at room temperature and room light for a maximum of 6 hours. Administration of diluted IXEMPRA must be completed within this 6-hour period. Administration The infusion solution must be administered through an appropriate in-line filter with a microporous membrane of 0.2 to 1.2 microns. DEHP-free infusion containers and administration sets must be used. Discard any remaining solution according to institutional procedures for hazardous drugs."
