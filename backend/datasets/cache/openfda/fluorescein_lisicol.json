    "DIRECTIONS FOR USE Procedure for measuring Fluorescein Break-up Time (FBUT) with Amcon Dry Eye Test Strips. 1. Apply one or two drops of non-preserved saline to the impregnated paper tip. Excess fluid will automatically fall off. Shaking is neither required nor desirable. 2. Ask the patient to look down and in. 3. Gently touch the strip to the superior temporal bulbar conjunctiva for one or two seconds. 4. Ask the patient to blink three times and open eyes naturally. 5. Conduct the FBUT measurements immediately. 6. Perform two consecutive measurements. If not consistent, conduct a third and average the results. 7. Repeat steps 1 through 6 using a new strip for the second eye FBUT values of less than 10 seconds are considered abnormal. Values less than 5 seconds are indicative of dry eye disorder. Values of 5 to 9 seconds are borderline dry eye. NOTE: The contents may not be sterile if the individual strip package has been damaged or previously opened. This product is intended for external use only. Keep out of reach of children. Store below 30\u00b0C."
