    "Drug Interactions Anticholinergic agents: Although ipratropium bromide is minimally absorbed into the systemic circulation, there is some potential for an additive interaction with concomitantly used anticholinergic medications. Caution is, therefore, advised in the co-administration of Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution with other drugs having anticholinergic properties."

  "warnings": [
    "WARNINGS Paradoxical Bronchospasm : In the clinical study of Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution, paradoxical bronchospasm was not observed. However, paradoxical bronchospasm has been observed with both inhaled ipratropium bromide and albuterol products and can be life-threatening. If this occurs, Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution should be discontinued immediately and alternative therapy instituted. Do Not Exceed Recommended Dose : Fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled products containing sympathomimetic amines and with the home use of nebulizers. Cardiovascular Effect: Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution, like other beta-adrenergic agonists, can produce a clinically significant cardiovascular effect in some patients as measured by pulse rate, blood pressure, and/or symptoms. Although such effects are uncommon for Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution at recommended doses, if they occur, the drug may need to be discontinued. In addition, beta-agonists have been reported to produce ECG changes, such as flattening of the T-wave, prolongation of the QTc interval, and ST segment depression. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Therefore, Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution, like other sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension. Immediate Hypersensitivity Reactions: Immediate hypersensitivity reactions to albuterol and/or ipratropium bromide may occur after the administration of Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution as demonstrated by rare cases of urticaria, angioedema, rash, pruritus, oropharyngeal edema, bronchospasm, and anaphylaxis."

In the clinical trial, there was a 0.3% incidence of possible allergic-type reactions, including skin rash, pruritis, and urticaria. Additional information derived from the published literature on the use of albuterol sulfate and ipratropium bromide singly or in combination includes precipitation or worsening of narrow-angle glaucoma, acute eye pain, blurred vision, mydriasis, paradoxical bronchospasm, wheezing, exacerbation of COPD symptoms, drowsiness, aching, flushing, upper respiratory tract infection, palpitations, taste perversion, elevated heart rate, sinusitis, back pain, sore throat and metabolic acidosis. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure."

  "contraindications": [
    "CONTRAINDICATIONS Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to any of its components, or to atropine and its derivatives."

  "dosage_administration": [
    "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The recommended dose of Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution is one 3 mL vial administered 4 times per day via nebulization with up to 2 additional 3 mL doses allowed per day, if needed. Safety and efficacy of additional doses or increased frequency of administration of Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution beyond these guidelines has not been studied and the safety and efficacy of extra doses of albuterol sulfate or ipratropium bromide in addition to the recommended doses of Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution have not been studied. The use of Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution can be continued as medically indicated to control recurring bouts of bronchospasm. If a previously effective regimen fails to provide the usual relief, medical advice should be sought immediately, as this is often a sign of worsening COPD, which would require reassessment of therapy. A Pari-LC-Plus\u2122 nebulizer (with face mask or mouthpiece) connected to a PRONEB\u2122 compressor was used to deliver Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution to each patient in one U.S. clinical study. The safety and efficacy of Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution delivered by other nebulizers and compressors have not been established. Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution should be administered via jet nebulizer connected to an air compressor with an adequate air flow, equipped with a mouthpiece or suitable face mask."
