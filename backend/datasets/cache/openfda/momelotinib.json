    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022 Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide (OATP)1B1/B3 inhibitors: Monitor for adverse reactions. ( 7.1 ) \u2022 Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) substrates: Reduce rosuvastatin (BCRP substrate) dosage. Follow approved product information recommendations for other BCRP substrates. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on OJJAARA Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide (OATP)1B1/B3 Inhibitors Momelotinib is an OATP1B1/B3 substrate. Concomitant use with an OATP1B1/B3 inhibitor increases momelotinib maximal concentrations (C max ) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )], which may increase the risk of adverse reactions with OJJAARA. Monitor patients concomitantly receiving an OATP1B1/B3 inhibitor for adverse reactions and consider OJJAARA dose modifications [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . 7.2 Effect of OJJAARA on Other Drugs Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) Substrates Momelotinib is a BCRP inhibitor. OJJAARA may increase exposure of BCRP substrates , which may increase the risk of BCRP substrate adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . When administered concomitantly with OJJAARA, initiate rosuvastatin (BCRP substrate) at 5 mg and do not increase to more than 10 mg once daily. Dose adjustment of other BCRP substrates may also be needed. Follow approved product information recommendations for other BCRP substrates."

    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: \u2022 Risk of Infections and Hepatitis B Reactivation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] \u2022 Thrombocytopenia and Neutropenia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] \u2022 Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] \u2022 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] \u2022 Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] \u2022 Thrombosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] \u2022 Malignancies [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] The most common adverse reactions (\u226520% in either study) are thrombocytopenia, hemorrhage, bacterial infection, fatigue, dizziness, diarrhea, and nausea. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact GlaxoSmithKline at 1-888-825-5249 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of OJJAARA was evaluated in 215 patients in 2 clinical trials (MOMENTUM and SIMPLIFY-1 anemic subgroup [hemoglobin (Hb) <10 g/dL]) [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . MOMENTUM Patients in the MOMENTUM trial had been previously treated with a JAK inhibitor and were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive double-blind OJJAARA 200 mg orally once daily (n = 130) or danazol 300 mg orally twice daily (n = 65) for 24 weeks, after which they were eligible to receive open-label OJJAARA in an extended treatment phase. Among patients who received OJJAARA, 72% were exposed for 24 weeks or longer and 52% were exposed for 48 weeks or longer [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . Serious adverse reactions occurred in 35% of patients who received OJJAARA during the randomized treatment period of the MOMENTUM trial; the most common serious adverse reactions (\u22652%) included bacterial infection (8%), viral infection (5%), hemorrhage (4%), acute kidney injury (3%), pneumonia (3%), pyrexia (3%), thrombosis (3%), syncope (2%), thrombocytopenia (2%), and renal and urinary tract infection (2%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 12% of patients who received OJJAARA; the most common (\u22652%) fatal adverse reaction was viral infection (5%). Permanent discontinuation of OJJAARA due to an adverse reaction occurred in 18% of patients during the randomized treatment period of the MOMENTUM trial. Adverse reactions that resulted in permanent discontinuation (\u22652%) included viral infection (2%) and thrombocytopenia (2%). Dosage reduction or treatment interruption due to an adverse reaction occurred in 34% of patients. Adverse reactions requiring dosage reduction and/or treatment interruption (\u22652%) included thrombocytopenia (13%), bacterial infection (2%), diarrhea (2%), and neutropenia (2%). Among the 130 patients treated with OJJAARA during the randomized treatment period of MOMENTUM, the most common adverse reactions (\u226520%) were thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, hemorrhage, and fatigue ( Table 2 ).

Upon completion of the double-blind treatment phase, all patients were eligible to receive OJJAARA during the open-label phase. The safety of OJJAARA was evaluated in the population of patients with MF who were anemic at study entry. SIMPLIFY-1 enrolled 180 anemic patients who received OJJAARA (n = 85) or ruxolitinib (n = 95). Among these anemic patients who received OJJAARA, 78% were exposed for 24 weeks or longer and 61% were exposed for 48 weeks or longer [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . Serious adverse reactions occurred in 28% of the anemic patients who received OJJAARA during the randomized treatment period of the SIMPLIFY-1 trial; the most common serious adverse reactions (\u22652%) included bacterial infection (7%), pneumonia (6%), heart failure (4%) arrhythmia (2%), and respiratory failure (2%). A fatal adverse reaction (bacterial infection) occurred in 1 patient who received OJJAARA. Permanent discontinuation of OJJAARA due to an adverse reaction occurred in 19% of the anemic patients during the randomized treatment period of the SIMPLIFY-1 trial. Adverse reactions that resulted in permanent discontinuation of OJJAARA (\u22652%) included bacterial infection (2%), dizziness (2%), fatigue (2%), hypotension (2%), and thrombocytopenia (2%). Dosage reductions or treatment interruptions of OJJAARA due to an adverse reaction occurred in 21% of patients. Adverse reactions requiring dosage reduction and/or treatment interruption (\u22652%) were thrombocytopenia (8%), pneumonia (4%), bacterial infection (2%), abdominal pain (2%), elevated liver enzymes (2%), and hypotension (2%). Among the 85 anemic patients treated with OJJAARA during the randomized treatment period of SIMPLIFY-1, the most common adverse reactions (\u226520%) were dizziness, fatigue, bacterial infection, hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, and nausea ( Table 3 ).

Infections and Infestations: Fungal infection (excludes opportunistic infections). Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: Arthralgia. Nervous System Disorders: Neuralgia, peripheral neuropathy, peripheral motor neuropathy, polyneuropathy, syncope. Vascular Disorders: Flushing. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of OJJAARA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)."
