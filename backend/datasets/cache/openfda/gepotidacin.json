    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022 CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Avoid coadministration of BLUJEPA with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. ( 7.1 ) \u2022 CYP3A4 Inducers: Avoid coadministration of BLUJEPA with strong CYP3A4 inducers ( 7.1 ) \u2022 CYP3A4 Substrates: Avoid coadministration of BLUJEPA with drugs that are extensively metabolized by CYP3A4 and have a narrow therapeutic window. ( 7.2 ) \u2022 Digoxin: Due to an increase in digoxin exposures, consider monitoring digoxin serum concentration, as appropriate, with concomitant administration of BLUJEPA. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on BLUJEPA CYP3A4 Inhibitors Due to an increase in gepotidacin exposures, avoid concomitant administration of BLUJEPA with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . CYP3A4 Inducers Due to a decrease in gepotidacin exposures, avoid concomitant administration of BLUJEPA with strong inducers of CYP3A4 [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.2 Effect of BLUJEPA on Other Drugs CYP3A4 Substrates Avoid concomitant administration of BLUJEPA with drugs that are extensively metabolized by CYP3A4 and have a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., quinidine, cyclosporine) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Digoxin Due to an increase in digoxin exposures, consider monitoring digoxin serum concentrations, as appropriate, with concomitant administration of BLUJEPA [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.3 Cholinergic/Anticholinergic Drugs As gepotidacin is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, there is potential for an exaggerated effect of concomitantly administered succinylcholine\u2011type neuromuscular blocking agents resulting in a delay in recovery of neuromuscular function. Gepotidacin may augment the effect of other acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (e.g., donepezil). Monitor for exaggerated neuromuscular blockade or excessive cholinergic effects [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . There is potential for an antagonistic effect with systemic anticholinergic medications (e.g., benztropine, oxybutynin) or non\u2011depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents. Consider the potential for this interaction if BLUJEPA is administered concomitantly with anticholinergic medications [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . 7.4 Drugs that Prolong the QTc Interval Due to the increased risk of QTc prolongation, avoid concomitant administration of BLUJEPA with other medications that have the potential to prolong the QTc interval [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] ."

    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: \u2022 QTc Prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . \u2022 Acetylcholinesterase Inhibition [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . \u2022 Clostridioides difficile Infection [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . The most common adverse reactions occurring in \u22651% of patients are diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, flatulence, headache, soft feces, dizziness, vomiting, and vulvovaginal candidiasis. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact GlaxoSmithKline at 1-888-825-5249 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of BLUJEPA was evaluated in 2 double\u2011blind, active\u2011controlled, randomized trials in female adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with uUTI (Trial 1 and Trial 2). A total of 1,570 patients were treated with BLUJEPA and 1,558 patients were treated with nitrofurantoin (pooled safety populations for BLUJEPA and nitrofurantoin, respectively). Patients received treatment for a median duration of 5 days. In Trials 1 and 2 (pooled, intent-to-treat [ITT] population), the median age of patients treated with BLUJEPA was 49 (range 13 to 89) years; <1% were <18 years, 77% of patients were 18 to 64 years, 14% were 65 to 74 years, and 8% were \u226575 years. Patients were female (100%) and White (83%), Black or African American (7%), Asian (5%), or American Indian or Alaskan Native (4%); for ethnicity, 33% identified as Hispanic/Latino and 67% as non-Hispanic/Latino. The majority of patients were enrolled from the U.S. (55%). Serious Adverse Reactions and Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation In the pooled trials (Trials 1 and 2), serious adverse reactions occurred in 1/1,570 (<1%) patient treated with BLUJEPA and 1/1,558 (<1%) patient treated with nitrofurantoin. The serious adverse reaction reported with BLUJEPA was dysarthria. No adverse reaction led to death in either treatment group. In the pooled trials, adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of treatment occurred in 79/1,570 (5%) of patients treated with BLUJEPA and 30/1,558 (2%) of patients treated with nitrofurantoin. Adverse reactions occurring in >1% of patients leading to treatment discontinuation in patients treated with BLUJEPA included diarrhea (3%) and nausea (1%). Common Adverse Reactions Table 1 lists the adverse reactions occurring in \u22651% of patients receiving BLUJEPA in the pooled trials (Trials 1 and 2). Table 1.

  "indications": [
    "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE BLUJEPA is a triazaacenaphthylene bacterial type II topoisomerase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of female adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kilograms (kg) with uncomplicated urinary tract infections (uUTI) caused by the following susceptible microorganisms: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii complex , Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and Enterococcus faecalis . ( 1.1 ) Usage to Reduce Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of BLUJEPA and other antibacterial drugs, BLUJEPA should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria. ( 1.2 ) 1.1 Treatment of Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infections BLUJEPA is indicated for the treatment of female adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kilograms (kg) with uncomplicated urinary tract infections (uUTI) caused by the following susceptible microorganisms: Escherichia coli , Klebsiella pneumoniae , Citrobacter freundii complex, Staphylococcus saprophyticus , and Enterococcus faecalis . 1.2 Usage to Reduce Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of BLUJEPA and other antibacterial drugs, BLUJEPA should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."
