    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Eribulin Mesylate Injection No drug-drug interactions are expected with CYP3A4 inhibitors, CYP3A4 inducers or P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors. Clinically meaningful differences in exposure (AUC) were not observed in patients with advanced solid tumors when eribulin mesylate injection was administered with or without ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 and a P-gp inhibitor) and when eribulin mesylate injection was administered with or without rifampin (a CYP3A4 inducer) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.2 Effects of Eribulin Mesylate Injection on Other Drugs Eribulin does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 or CYP3A4 enzymes or induce CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or CYP3A4 enzymes at relevant clinical concentrations. Eribulin is not expected to alter the plasma concentrations of drugs that are substrates of these enzymes [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (\u226525%) in metastatic breast cancer were neutropenia, anemia, asthenia/fatigue, alopecia, peripheral neuropathy, nausea, and constipation. ( 6.1 ) The most common adverse reactions (\u226525%) in liposarcoma and leiomyosarcoma were fatigue, nausea, alopecia, constipation, peripheral neuropathy, abdominal pain, and pyrexia. The most common (\u22655%) Grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities in liposarcoma and leiomyosarcoma were neutropenia, hypokalemia, and hypocalcemia. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Long Grove Pharmaceuticals, LLC at 1-855-642-2594 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in other clinical trials and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The following adverse reactions are discussed in detail in other sections of the labeling: Neutropenia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Peripheral neuropathy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] QT prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] In clinical trials, eribulin mesylate injection has been administered to 1963 patients including 467 patients exposed to eribulin mesylate injection for 6 months or longer. The majority of the 1963 patients were women (92%) with a median age of 55 years (range: 17 to 85 years). The racial and ethnic distribution was White (72%), Black (4%), Asian (9%), and other (3%). Metastatic Breast Cancer The most common adverse reactions (\u226525%) reported in patients receiving eribulin mesylate injection were neutropenia, anemia, asthenia/fatigue, alopecia, peripheral neuropathy, nausea, and constipation. The most common serious adverse reactions reported in patients receiving eribulin mesylate injection were febrile neutropenia (4%) and neutropenia (2%). The most common adverse reaction resulting in discontinuation of eribulin mesylate injection was peripheral neuropathy (5%). The adverse reactions described in Table 2 were identified in 750 patients treated in Study 1 [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . In Study 1, patients were randomized (2:1) to receive either eribulin mesylate injection (1.4 mg/m 2 on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle) or single agent treatment chosen by their physician (control group). A total of 503 patients received eribulin mesylate injection and 247 patients in the control group received therapy consisting of chemotherapy [total 97% (anthracyclines 10%, capecitabine 18%, gemcitabine 19%, taxanes 15%, vinorelbine 25%, other chemotherapies 10%)] or hormonal therapy (3%). The median duration of exposure was 118 days for patients receiving eribulin mesylate injection and 63 days for patients receiving control therapy. Table 2 reports the most common adverse reactions occurring in at least 10% of patients in either group. Table 2: Adverse Reactions a with a Per-Patient Incidence of at Least 10% in Study 1 a adverse reactions were graded per National Cancer Institute Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. b based upon laboratory data. c includes peripheral neuropathy, peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy, peripheral motor neuropathy, polyneuropathy, peripheral sensory neuropathy, and paraesthesia. d not applicable; (grading system does not specify > Grade 2 for alopecia).

Febrile neutropenia occurred in 5% (23/503) of patients; two patients (0.4%) died from complications of febrile neutropenia. Dose reduction due to neutropenia was required in 12% (62/503) of patients and discontinuation was required in <1% of patients. The mean time to nadir was 13 days and the mean time to recovery from severe neutropenia (<500/mm 3 ) was 8 days. Grade 3 or greater thrombocytopenia occurred in 1% (7/503) of patients. G-CSF (granulocyte colonystimulating factor) or GM-CSF (granulocyte\u2013macrophage colony-stimulating factor) was used in 19% of patients who received eribulin mesylate injection. Peripheral Neuropathy : In Study 1, 17% of enrolled patients had Grade 1 peripheral neuropathy and 3% of patients had Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy at baseline. Dose reduction due to peripheral neuropathy was required by 3% (14/503) of patients who received eribulin mesylate injection. Four percent (20/503) of patients experienced peripheral motor neuropathy of any grade and 2% (8/503) of patients developed Grade 3 peripheral motor neuropathy. Liver Function Test Abnormalities : Among patients with Grade 0 or 1 ALT levels at baseline, 18% of eribulin mesylate injection -treated patients experienced Grade 2 or greater ALT elevation. One eribulin mesylate injection-treated patient without documented liver metastases had concomitant Grade 2 elevations in bilirubin and ALT; these abnormalities resolved and did not recur with re-exposure to eribulin mesylate injection. Less Common Adverse Reactions : The following additional adverse reactions were reported in \u22655% to <10% of the eribulin mesylate injection-treated group: Eye Disorders: increased lacrimation Gastrointestinal Disorders: dyspepsia, abdominal pain, stomatitis, dry mouth General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: peripheral edema Infections and Infestations: upper respiratory tract infection Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: hypokalemia Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: muscle spasms, muscular weakness Nervous System Disorders: dysgeusia, dizziness Psychiatric Disorders: insomnia, depression Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: rash Liposarcoma The safety of eribulin mesylate injection was evaluated in Study 2, an open-label, randomized, multicenter, active-controlled trial, in which patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either eribulin mesylate injection 1.4 mg/m 2 on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle or dacarbazine at doses of 850 mg/m 2 (20%), 1000 mg/m 2 (64%), or 1200 mg/m 2 (16%) every 3 weeks. A total of 223 patients received eribulin mesylate injection and 221 patients received dacarbazine. Patients were required to have received at least two prior systemic chemotherapy regimens. The trial excluded patients with pre-existing \u2265 Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy, known central nervous system metastasis, elevated serum bilirubin or significant chronic liver disease, history of myocardial infarction within 6 months, history of New York Heart Association Class II or IV heart failure, or cardiac arrhythmia requiring treatment. The median age of the safety population in Study 2 was 56 years (range: 24 to 83 years); 67% female; 73% White, 3% Black or African American, 8% Asian/Pacific Islander, and 15% unknown; 99% received prior anthracycline-containing regimen; and 99% received \u2265 2 prior regimens. The median duration of exposure was 2.3 months (range: 21 days to 26 months) for patients receiving eribulin mesylate injection [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . The most common adverse reactions (\u226525%) reported in patients receiving eribulin mesylate injection were fatigue, nausea, alopecia, constipation, peripheral neuropathy, abdominal pain, and pyrexia. The most common (\u22655%) Grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities reported in patients receiving eribulin mesylate injection were neutropenia, hypokalemia, and hypocalcemia. The most common serious adverse reactions reported in patients receiving eribulin mesylate injection were neutropenia (4.9%) and pyrexia (4.5%). Permanent discontinuation of eribulin mesylate injection for adverse reactions occurred in 8% of patients. The most common adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of eribulin mesylate injection were fatigue and thrombocytopenia (0.9% each). Twenty-six percent of patients required at least one dose reduction. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to dose reduction were neutropenia (18%) and peripheral neuropathy (4.0%).
