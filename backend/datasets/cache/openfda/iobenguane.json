    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The following drugs have the potential to decrease the uptake of norepinephrine and cause false negative imaging results: antihypertensives that deplete norepinephrine stores or inhibit reuptake (e.g., reserpine, labetalol), antidepressants that inhibit norepinephrine transporter function (e.g., amitriptyline and derivatives, imipramine and derivatives, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), sympathomimetic amines (e.g., phenylephrine, phenylpropanolamine, pseudoephedrine and ephedrine), and cocaine. Clinical studies have not determined which specific drugs may cause false negative imaging results nor whether all drugs in any specific pharmacologic class have the same potential to produce the negative imaging results. Increasing the dose of AdreView will not overcome any potential uptake limiting effect of these drugs. Before AdreView administration, discontinue (for at least 5 biological half-lives) drugs known or expected to reduce norepinephrine uptake, as clinically tolerated. Amitryptiline and derivatives, imipramine and derivatives, other antidepressants that inhibit norepinephrine transporter, antihypertensives that deplete norepinephrine stores or inhibit reuptake, sympathomimetic amines and cocaine: Discontinue for 5 biological half-lives prior to AdreView administration ( 7 )"

    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Serious hypersensitivity reactions have been reported following AdreView administration. The most common adverse reactions, dizziness, rash, pruritis, flushing, headache, and injection site hemorrhage occurred in < 1.3% of patients. ( 6.1 , 6.2 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact GE Healthcare at 1-800-654-0118 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Study Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. During clinical development 1346 patients were exposed to AdreView, 251 patients with known or suspected pheochromocytoma or neuroblastoma, 985 patients with heart failure, and 110 control patients. All patients were monitored for adverse reactions over a 24 hour period following AdreView administration. Pheochromocytoma and Neuroblastoma Serious adverse reactions were not observed in the AdreView clinical study. Adverse reactions were all mild to moderate in severity and were predominantly isolated occurrences (\u2264 2 patients) of one of the following reactions: dizziness, rash, pruritus, flushing or injection site hemorrhage. Congestive Heart Failure No serious adverse reactions to AdreView were observed in clinical studies. Adverse reactions that occurred with a frequency > 1% were associated with the injection site (1.3%), problems such as hematoma and bruising. The other most common reactions were flushing (0.3%) and headache (0.4%). The adverse reactions were predominantly of mild to moderate intensity. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity reactions have uncommonly been reported during the postmarketing use of AdreView [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]."

    "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION AdreView emits radiation and must be handled with appropriate safety measures. ( 2.1 , 2.6 ) Administer thyroid blockade medications to patients at risk for thyroid accumulation of AdreView. ( 2.2 , 5.6 ) Measure patient dose by a suitable radioactivity calibration system immediately prior to administration. ( 2.4 ) For patients \u2265 16 years of age or < 16 years of age and \u2265 70 kg: administer 10 mCi (370 MBq). ( 2.4 , 2.5 ) For patients < 16 years of age and < 70 kg: amount scaled to the adult reference activity based on weight. ( 2.5 ) 2.1 Radiation Safety AdreView emits radiation and must be handled with appropriate safety measures to minimize radiation exposure to clinical personnel and patients. Radiopharmaceuticals should be used by or under the control of physicians who are qualified by specific training and experience in the safe use and handling of radionuclides, and whose experience and training have been approved by the appropriate government agency authorized to license the use of radionuclides. AdreView dosing is based upon the radioactivity determined using a suitable calibration system immediately prior to administration. To minimize radiation dose to the bladder, prior to and following AdreView administration, encourage hydration to permit frequent voiding. Encourage the patient to void frequently for the first 48 hours following AdreView administration [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. 2.2 Thyroid Blockade Before administration of AdreView to patients at risk for thyroid accumulation of the drug, administer Potassium Iodide Oral Solution or Lugol's Solution (equivalent to 100 mg iodide for adults, body-weight adjusted for children) or potassium perchlorate (400 mg for adults, body-weight adjusted for children) to block uptake of iodine 123 by the patient's thyroid. Administer the blocking agent at least one hour before the dose of AdreView [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. Individualize thyroid blockade; for example, the blockade may not be necessary for patients who have undergone thyroidectomy or those with a very limited life expectancy. 2.3 Preparation and Administration Assess pregnancy status before administering AdreView to a female of reproductive potential. Inspect the AdreView vial for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Use aseptic procedures and a radiation shielding syringe during administration. Administer the dose as an intravenous injection over 1 to 2 minutes. A subsequent injection of 0.9% sodium chloride may be used to ensure full delivery of the dose. 2.4 Recommended Dose for Adults For adults (\u2265 16 years of age), the recommended dose is 10 mCi (370 MBq) [ see Clinical Studies (14.1 , 14.2) ]. 2.5 Recommended Dose for Pediatric Patients For pediatric patients < 16 years of age weighing \u2265 70 kg, the recommended dose is 10 mCi (370 MBq) [ see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. For pediatric patients < 16 years of age weighing < 70 kg, the recommended dose should be calculated according to patient body weight as shown in Table 1 [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . The benzyl alcohol in AdreView may cause serious adverse reactions in premature or low birth-weight infants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . Table 1.

Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) may be performed following planar scintigraphy, as appropriate [ see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. Congestive Heart Failure Begin anterior planar imaging of the chest at 4 hours (\u00b1 10 minutes) following administration of AdreView. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) can then be performed. The recommended collimator for all imaging is a low-energy high-resolution. The recommended matrix for planar images is 128\u00d7128. The camera should be positioned to include the entire heart and as much of the upper chest as possible within the field of view [ see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. 2.8 Estimation of the H/M Ratio among Patients with Congestive Heart Failure Initial evaluation of cardiac AdreView images involves visual examination of the location, pattern and intensity of cardiac radioactivity uptake to guide quantitative assessment (see Step 1 below). Perform quantitative assessment of radioactivity uptake in terms of the heart/mediastinum ratio (H/M) on anterior planar images of the chest (see Step 2 below). Step 1. Visual Guidelines for AdreView Cardiac Uptake on Anterior Planar Chest Images a. Normal: Distinct visualization of the left ventricular myocardium in the left lower chest, with greater uptake in the heart than in the adjacent lungs and mediastinum (Figure 1). Figure 1. Normal anterior planar AdreView image of the chest b. Abnormal: Homogeneously or heterogeneously decreased cardiac uptake, with indistinct or absent visualization of the left ventricular myocardium. Cardiac activity is usually less than or equal to that of the adjacent left lung (Figure 2a). In extreme cases, little or no AdreView uptake is seen in the left lower chest (Figure 2b). Figure 2. Abnormal anterior planar AdreView images of the chest: a) Heterogeneously reduced cardiac uptake; b) Absent cardiac uptake Figure 2a Figure 2b Figure 1 Figure 2a Figure 2b Step 2. Quantitate AdreView Cardiac Uptake The AdreView H/M ratio is determined from the activity in heart (H) and mediastinum (M) regions of interest (ROIs) drawn on the anterior planar chest image (Figure 3) using the following procedure: Draw an irregular ROI defining the epicardial border of the heart. If the epicardial border cannot be defined because all or the majority of the myocardium is not visualized, draw the ROI based upon the presumed location of the heart, using the medial aspects of the left and right lower lung for anatomical guidance. Draw a horizontal line to mark the estimated location of the lung apices. If the most superior aspect of the image does not include the lung apices (because of limited field of view for a small gamma camera), draw this line at the top of the image display. Draw a vertical line approximately equidistant from the medial aspects of the right and left lung. Examine the counts for the 12 pixels along the vertical line starting 4 pixels below the intersection point with the horizontal line determined in step 2, and identify the pixel with the lowest counts. If more than one pixel has this same number of counts, choose the most superiorly located pixel. Using the pixel defined in step 4 as the center, draw a square ROI of 7\u00d77 dimensions. Calculate the H/M ratio by dividing the counts/pixel in the total myocardium ROI determined in step 1 by the counts/pixel in the 7\u00d77 pixel mediastinal ROI determined in step 5. Figure 3. Illustration of creation of regions of interest for determination of the H/M ratio Figure 3 Step 3. Interpretation of AdreView H/M Ratio The expected range for AdreView H/M ratio is 1.0 to 2.4 [ see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. Figure 4.
