    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022 Strong CYP3A Inducers or Moderate CYP2C8 Inducers : Avoid concomitant use. ( 7.1 ) \u2022 Strong CYP2C8 Inhibitors : Avoid concomitant use; reduce TUKYSA dose if concomitant use cannot be avoided. ( 2.4 , 7.1 ) \u2022 CYP3A Substrates : Avoid concomitant use with CYP3A substrates, where minimal concentration changes may lead to serious or life-threatening toxicities. ( 7.2 ) \u2022 P-gp Substrates : Consider reducing the dose of P-gp substrates, where minimal concentration changes may lead to serious or life-threatening toxicities. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on TUKYSA Table 7 summarizes the effect of other drugs on TUKYSA. Table 7: Drug Interactions that Affect TUKYSA Strong CYP3A Inducers or Moderate CYP2C8 Inducers Clinical Impact Concomitant use of TUKYSA with a strong CYP3A or moderate CYP2C8 inducer decreased tucatinib plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] , which may reduce TUKYSA activity. Management Avoid concomitant use of TUKYSA with a strong CYP3A inducer or a moderate CYP2C8 inducer. Strong or Moderate CYP2C8 Inhibitors Clinical Impact Concomitant use of TUKYSA with a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor increased tucatinib plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] , which may increase the risk of TUKYSA toxicity. Management Avoid concomitant use of TUKYSA with a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor. Increase monitoring for TUKYSA toxicity with moderate CYP2C8 inhibitors. 7.2 Effects of TUKYSA on Other Drugs Table 8 summarizes the effect of TUKYSA on other drugs. Table 8: TUKYSA Drug Interactions that Affect Other Drugs CYP3A Substrates Clinical Impact Concomitant use of TUKYSA with a CYP3A substrate increased the plasma concentrations of CYP3A substrate [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] , which may increase the toxicity associated with a CYP3A substrate. Management Avoid concomitant use of TUKYSA with CYP3A substrates, where minimal concentration changes may lead to serious or life-threatening toxicities. If concomitant use is unavoidable, decrease the CYP3A substrate dosage in accordance with approved product labeling. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) Substrates Clinical Impact Concomitant use of TUKYSA with a P-gp substrate increased the plasma concentrations of P-gp substrate [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] , which may increase the toxicity associated with a P-gp substrate. Management Consider reducing the dosage of P-gp substrates, where minimal concentration changes may lead to serious or life-threatening toxicities."

To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Seagen at 1-855-4SEAGEN or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer The safety of TUKYSA in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine was evaluated in HER2CLIMB [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. Patients received either TUKYSA 300 mg twice daily plus trastuzumab or a non-US approved trastuzumab product, and capecitabine (n=404) or placebo plus trastuzumab or a non-US approved trastuzumab product and capecitabine (n=197). The median duration of treatment was 5.8 months (range: 3 days, 2.9 years) for the TUKYSA arm. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 26% of patients who received TUKYSA. Serious adverse reactions in \u2265 2% of patients who received TUKYSA were diarrhea (4%), vomiting (2.5%), nausea (2%), abdominal pain (2%), and seizure (2%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 2% of patients who received TUKYSA including sudden death, sepsis, dehydration, and cardiogenic shock. Adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation occurred in 6% of patients who received TUKYSA. Adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation of TUKYSA in \u22651% of patients were hepatotoxicity (1.5%) and diarrhea (1%). Adverse reactions leading to dose reduction occurred in 21% of patients who received TUKYSA. Adverse reactions leading to dose reduction of TUKYSA in \u22652% of patients were hepatotoxicity (8%) and diarrhea (6%). The most common adverse reactions in patients who received TUKYSA (\u226520%) were diarrhea, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, nausea, hepatotoxicity, vomiting, stomatitis, decreased appetite, anemia, and rash. Table 3 summarizes the adverse reactions in HER2CLIMB.

RAS Wild-Type, HER2-Positive Unresectable or Metastatic Colorectal Cancer The safety of TUKYSA in combination with trastuzumab or a non-US approved trastuzumab product was evaluated in 86 patients enrolled in MOUNTAINEER with unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . The median duration of exposure to TUKYSA was 6.9 months (range 0.7, 49.3). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 22% of patients.
