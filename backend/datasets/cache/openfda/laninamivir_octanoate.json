    "WARNINGS AZELEX \u00ae Cream is for dermatologic use only and not for ophthalmic use. There have been isolated reports of hypopigmentation after use of azelaic acid. Since azelaic acid has not been well studied in patients with dark complexions, these patients should be monitored for early signs of hypopigmentation."
  ],
  "adverse_reactions": [
    "ADVERSE REACTIONS During U.S. clinical trials with AZELEX \u00ae Cream, adverse reactions were generally mild and transient in nature. The most common adverse reactions occurring in approximately 1-5% of patients were pruritus, burning, stinging and tingling. Other adverse reactions such as erythema, dryness, rash, peeling, irritation, dermatitis, and contact dermatitis were reported in less than 1% of subjects. There is the potential for experiencing allergic reactions with use of AZELEX \u00ae Cream. In patients using azelaic acid formulations, the following additional adverse experiences have been reported rarely: worsening of asthma, vitiligo depigmentation, small depigmented spots, hypertrichosis, reddening (signs of keratosis pilaris), and exacerbation of recurrent herpes labialis."
