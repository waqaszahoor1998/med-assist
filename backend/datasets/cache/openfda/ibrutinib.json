    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS CYP3A Inhibitors: Modify IMBRUVICA dose as described ( 2.3 , 7.1 ). CYP3A Inducers: Avoid coadministration with strong CYP3A inducers ( 7.2 ). 7.1 Effect of CYP3A Inhibitors on Ibrutinib The coadministration of IMBRUVICA with a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor may increase ibrutinib plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Increased ibrutinib concentrations may increase the risk of drug-related toxicity. Dose modifications of IMBRUVICA are recommended when used concomitantly with posaconazole, voriconazole and moderate CYP3A inhibitors [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )]. Avoid concomitant use of other strong CYP3A inhibitors. Interrupt IMBRUVICA if these inhibitors will be used short-term (such as anti-infectives for seven days or less) [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) ] . Avoid grapefruit and Seville oranges during IMBRUVICA treatment, as these contain strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP3A. 7.2 Effect of CYP3A Inducers on Ibrutinib The coadministration of IMBRUVICA with strong CYP3A inducers may decrease ibrutinib concentrations. Avoid coadministration with strong CYP3A inducers [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] ."

    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Infections [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Cardiac Arrhythmias, Cardiac Failure, and Sudden Death [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Cytopenias [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Second Primary Malignancies [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] Hepatotoxicity, including DILI [see Warning s and Precautions ( 5.7 )] Tumor Lysis Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] The most common (\u226530%) adverse reactions in patients with B-cell malignancies are thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, neutropenia, rash, anemia, bruising, and nausea ( 6 ). The most common (\u226520%) adverse reactions in adult or pediatric patients with cGVHD are fatigue, anemia, bruising, diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, musculoskeletal pain, pyrexia, muscle spasms, stomatitis, hemorrhage, nausea, abdominal pain, pneumonia, and headache ( 6 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Pharmacyclics at 1-877-877-3536 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely variable conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates of clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Unless otherwise specified, the pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to IMBRUVICA in 6 trials. IMBRUVICA was administered as a single agent at 420 mg orally once daily (475 patients), as a single agent at 560 mg orally once daily [1.3 times the recommended adult dosage (174 patients)], and in combination with other drugs at 420 mg orally once daily (827 patients) in patients with B-cell malignancies. In this pooled safety population of 1,476 patients, 87% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 68% were exposed for greater than one year. The most common adverse reactions (\u2265 30%) were thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, neutropenia, rash, anemia, bruising, and nausea. Certain subsections in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS include patients who received IMBRUVICA in unapproved monotherapy or combination regimens. Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma The data described below reflect exposure to IMBRUVICA in one single-arm, open-label clinical trial (Study 1102) and five randomized controlled clinical trials (RESONATE, RESONATE-2, HELIOS, iLLUMINATE, and E1912) in patients with CLL/SLL (n=2,016 total, including n=1,133 patients exposed to IMBRUVICA). In general, patients with creatinine clearance (CLcr) \u2264 30 mL/min, AST or ALT \u2265 2.5 x ULN, or total bilirubin \u2265 1.5 x ULN (unless of non-hepatic origin) were excluded from these trials. In Study E1912, patients with AST or ALT > 3 x ULN or total bilirubin > 2.5 x ULN were excluded. Study 1102 included 51 patients with previously treated CLL/SLL. RESONATE included 386 randomized patients with previously treated CLL or SLL who received single agent IMBRUVICA or ofatumumab. RESONATE-2 included 267 randomized patients with treatment na\u00efve CLL or SLL who were 65 years or older and received single agent IMBRUVICA or chlorambucil. HELIOS included 574 randomized patients with previously treated CLL or SLL who received IMBRUVICA in combination with BR or placebo in combination with BR. iLLUMINATE included 228 randomized patients with treatment na\u00efve CLL/SLL who were 65 years or older or with coexisting medical conditions and received IMBRUVICA in combination with obinutuzumab or chlorambucil in combination with obinutuzumab. E1912 included 510 patients with previously untreated CLL/SLL who were 70 years or younger and received IMBRUVICA in combination with rituximab or received fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR). The most common adverse reactions in patients with CLL/SLL receiving IMBRUVICA (\u2265 30%) were thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, neutropenia, rash, anemia, bruising, and nausea. Four to 10 percent of patients with CLL/SLL receiving IMBRUVICA discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions. These included pneumonia, hemorrhage, atrial fibrillation, neutropenia, arthralgia, rash, and thrombocytopenia. Adverse reactions leading to dose reduction occurred in approximately 9% of patients. Study 1102 Adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities from Study 1102 (N=51) using single agent IMBRUVICA 420 mg daily in patients with previously treated CLL/SLL occurring at a rate of \u2265 10% with a median duration of treatment of 15.6 months are presented in Table 5 and Table 6 .

Patients age 12 years and older were treated with IMBRUVICA 420 mg orally once daily, and patients age 1 year to less than 12 years were treated with IMBRUVICA 240 mg/m 2 orally once daily [see Clinical Studies ( 14.3 )] . The median duration of exposure to IMBRUVICA was 7.1 months (range, 0.2 to 25.9 months). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 64% of patients who received IMBRUVICA. Serious adverse reactions in more than two patients included pneumonia, pyrexia, sepsis, and stomatitis. Fatal adverse reactions occurred in two patients who received IMBRUVICA, including sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Permanent discontinuation of IMBRUVICA due to an adverse reaction occurred in 23% of patients. Adverse reactions which resulted in permanent discontinuation in at least two patients included hemorrhage. Dose reductions of IMBRUVICA due to an adverse reaction occurred in 19% of patients. Adverse reactions which required dose reduction in at least two patients included stomatitis. The most common (\u2265 20%) adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were anemia, musculoskeletal pain, pyrexia, diarrhea, pneumonia, abdominal pain, stomatitis, thrombocytopenia, and headache.

Additional Important Adverse Reactions Cardiovascular Events Data on cardiovascular events are based on randomized controlled trials with IMBRUVICA (n=2,115; median treatment duration of 19.1 months for 1,157 patients treated with IMBRUVICA and 5.3 months for 958 patients in the control arm). The incidence of ventricular tachyarrhythmias (ventricular extrasystoles, ventricular arrhythmias, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular flutter, and ventricular tachycardia) of any grade was 1.0% versus 0.4% and of Grade 3 or greater was 0.3% versus 0% in patients treated with IMBRUVICA compared to patients in the control arm. The incidence of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter of any grade was 8.4% versus 1.6% and for Grade 3 or greater was 4.0% versus 0.5% in patients treated with IMBRUVICA compared to patients in the control arm. In addition, the incidence of cardiac failure of any grade was 1.7% versus 0.5% and for Grade 3 or greater was 1.2% versus 0.3% in patients treated with IMBRUVICA compared to patients in the control arm. The incidence of ischemic cerebrovascular events (cerebrovascular accidents, ischemic stroke, cerebral ischemia, and transient ischemic attack) of any grade was 1% versus 0.4% and Grade 3 or greater was 0.5% versus 0.2% in patients treated with IMBRUVICA compared to patients in the control arm, respectively. Diarrhea In randomized controlled trials (n=2,115; median treatment duration of 19.1 months for 1,157 patients treated with IMBRUVICA and 5.3 months for 958 patients in the control arm), diarrhea of any grade occurred at a rate of 43% of patients treated with IMBRUVICA compared to 19% of patients in the control arm. Grade 3 diarrhea occurred in 3% versus 1% of IMBRUVICA-treated patients compared to the control arm, respectively. Less than 1% (0.3%) of subjects discontinued IMBRUVICA due to diarrhea compared with 0% in the control arm. Based on data from 1,605 of these patients, the median time to first onset was 21 days (range, 0 to 708) versus 46 days (range, 0 to 492) for any grade diarrhea and 117 days (range, 3 to 414) versus 194 days (range, 11 to 325) for Grade 3 diarrhea in IMBRUVICA-treated patients compared to the control arm, respectively. Of the patients who reported diarrhea, 85% versus 89% had complete resolution, and 15% versus 11% had not reported resolution at time of analysis in IMBRUVICA-treated patients compared to the control arm, respectively. The median time from onset to resolution in IMBRUVICA-treated subjects was 7 days (range, 1 to 655) versus 4 days (range, 1 to 367) for any grade diarrhea and 7 days (range, 1 to 78) versus 19 days (range, 1 to 56) for Grade 3 diarrhea in IMBRUVICA-treated subjects compared to the control arm, respectively. Visual Disturbance In randomized controlled trials (n=2,115; median treatment duration of 19.1 months for 1,157 patients treated with IMBRUVICA and 5.3 months for 958 patients in the control arm), blurred vision and decreased visual acuity of any grade occurred in 11% of patients treated with IMBRUVICA (9% Grade 1, 2% Grade 2, no Grade 3 or higher) compared to 6% in the control arm (5% Grade 1 and < 1% Grade 2 and 3). Based on data from 1,605 of these patients, the median time to first onset was 91 days (range, 0 to 617) versus 100 days (range, 2 to 477) in IMBRUVICA-treated patients compared to the control arm, respectively. Of the patients who reported visual disturbances, 60% versus 71% had complete resolution and 40% versus 29% had not reported resolution at the time of analysis in IMBRUVICA-treated patients compared to the control arm, respectively. The median time from onset to resolution was 37 days (range, 1 to 457) versus 26 days (range, 1 to 721) in IMBRUVICA-treated subjects compared to the control arm, respectively. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of IMBRUVICA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hepatobiliary disorders: hepatic failure including acute and/or fatal events, hepatic cirrhosis, drug-induced liver injury Respiratory disorders: interstitial lung disease Metabolic and nutrition disorders: tumor lysis syndrome Immune system disorders: anaphylactic shock, angioedema, urticaria Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), onychoclasis, panniculitis, neutrophilic dermatoses, cutaneous vasculitis Infections: hepatitis B reactivation Nervous system disorders: peripheral neuropathy"
