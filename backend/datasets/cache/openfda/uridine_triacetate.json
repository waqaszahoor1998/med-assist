    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022 Allopurinol: Avoid concomitant use of allopurinol with capecitabine tablets. ( 7.1 ) \u2022 Leucovorin : Closely monitor for toxicities when capecitabine tablets is coadministered with leucovorin. ( 7.1 ) \u2022 CYP2C9 substrates : Closely monitor for adverse reactions when CYP2C9 substrates are coadministered with capecitabine tablets. ( 7.2 ) \u2022 Vitamin K antagonists : Monitor INR more frequently and dose adjust oral vitamin K antagonist as appropriate \u2022 Phenytoin : Closely monitor phenytoin levels in patients taking capecitabine tablets concomitantly with phenytoin and adjust the phenytoin dose as appropriate. ( 7.2 ) \u2022 Nephrotoxic drugs : Closely monitor for signs of renal toxicity when capecitabine tablets is used concomitantly with nephrotoxic drugs. ( 7.3 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on Capecitabine Tablets Allopurinol Concomitant use with allopurinol may decrease concentration of capecitabine\u2019s active metabolites [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )], which may decrease efficacy. Avoid concomitant use of allopurinol with capecitabine tablets. Leucovorin The concentration of fluorouracil is increased and its toxicity may be enhanced by leucovorin, folic acid, or folate analog products. Deaths from severe enterocolitis, diarrhea, and dehydration have been reported in elderly patients receiving weekly leucovorin and fluorouracil. Instruct patients not to take products containing folic acid or folate analog products unless directed to do so by their healthcare provider. 7.2 Effect of Capecitabine Tablets on Other Drugs CYP2C9 Substrates Capecitabine tablets increased exposure of CYP2C9 substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ], which may increase the risk of adverse reactions related to these substrates. Closely monitor for adverse reactions of CYP2C9 substrates where minimal concentration changes may lead to serious adverse reactions when used concomitantly with capecitabine tablets (e.g., anticoagulants, antidiabetic drugs). Vitamin K Antagonists Capecitabine tablets increases exposure of vitamin K antagonist [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ], which may alter coagulation parameters and/or bleeding and could result in death [see Warning and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. These events may occur within days of treatment initiation and up to 1 month after discontinuation of capecitabine tablets. Monitor INR more frequently and refer to the prescribing information of oral vitamin K antagonist for dosage adjustment, as appropriate, when capecitabine tablets is used concomitantly with vitamin K antagonist. Phenytoin Capecitabine tablets may increases exposure of phenytoin, which may increase the risk of adverse reactions related to phenytoin. Closely monitor phenytoin levels and refer to the prescribing information of phenytoin for dosage adjustment, as appropriate, when capecitabine tablets is used concomitantly with phenytoin. 7.3 Nephrotoxic Drugs Due of the additive pharmacologic effect, concomitant use of capecitabine tablets with other drugs known to cause renal toxicity may increase the risk of renal toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )]. Closely monitor for signs of renal toxicity when capecitabine tablets is used concomitantly with nephrotoxic drugs (e.g. platinum salts, irinotecan, methotrexate, intravenous bisphosphonates)."

Refer to the Prescribing Information for docetaxel for additional dosing information as appropriate. Table 1 Recommended Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions Severity Dosage Modification Resume at Sameor Reduced Dose (Percentof Current Dose) Grade 2 1st appearance Withhold until resolved to grade 0-1. 100% 2nd appearance 75% 3rd appearance 50% 4th appearance Permanently discontinue. - Grade 3 1st appearance Withholduntil resolved to grade 0-1. 75% 2nd appearance 50% 3rd appearance Permanently discontinue. - Grade 4 1st appearance Permanently discontinue OR Withhold until resolved to grade 0-1. 50% Hyperbilirubinemia Patients with Grade 3-4 hyperbilirubinemia may resume treatment once the event is Grade 2 or less (less than three times the upper limit of normal), using the percent of current dose as shown in column 3 of Table 1 [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10 )]. 2.6 Dosage Modification For Renal Impairment Reduce the dose of capecitabine tablets by 25% for patients with creatinine clearance (CLcr) of 30 to 50 mL/min as determined by Cockcroft-Gault equation. A dosage has not been established in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. 2.7 Administration Round the recommended dosage for patients to the nearest 150 mg dose to provide whole capecitabine tablets.
