The pooled safety population described in the Warnings and Precautions reflect exposure to Kyprolis in 2,239 patients administered in combination with other drugs in ASPIRE, ENDEAVOR, A.R.R.O.W., CANDOR, IKEMA, EQUULEUS, and PLEIADES. The most common adverse reactions occurring in at least 20% of patients who received Kyprolis in combination were anemia, diarrhea, hypertension, fatigue, upper respiratory tract infection, thrombocytopenia, pyrexia, cough, dyspnea, and insomnia. Kyprolis in Combination with Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone The safety of Kyprolis 20/27 mg/m 2 twice weekly in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (KRd) was evaluated in ASPIRE [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . The median number of cycles initiated was 22 cycles for the KRd arm and 14 cycles for the Rd arm. Deaths due to adverse reactions within 30 days of the last dose of any therapy in the KRd arm occurred in 45/392 (12%) patients compared with 42/389 (11%) patients who died due to adverse reactions within 30 days of the last dose of any Rd therapy. The most frequent cause of deaths occurring in patients (%) in the two arms (KRd versus Rd) included infection 12 (3%) versus 11 (3%), cardiac 10 (3%) versus 9 (2%), and other adverse reactions 23 (6%) versus 22 (6%). Serious adverse reactions were reported in 65% of the patients in the KRd arm and 57% of the patients in the Rd arm. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in the KRd arm as compared with the Rd arm were pneumonia (17% versus 13%), respiratory tract infection (4% versus 2%), pyrexia (4% versus 3%), and pulmonary embolism (3% versus 2%). Discontinuation due to any adverse reaction occurred in 33% in the KRd arm versus 30% in the Rd arm. Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of Kyprolis occurred in 12% of patients and the most common reactions included pneumonia (1%), myocardial infarction (0.8%), and upper respiratory tract infection (0.8%). The incidence of cardiac failure events was 7% in the KRd arm versus 4% in the Rd arm. Table 8 summarizes the adverse reactions in the first 12 cycles in ASPIRE.

The safety of Kyprolis in combination with dexamethasone was evaluated in A.R.R.O.W. [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Patients received treatment for a median duration of 38 weeks in the Kd 20/70 mg/m 2 arm once weekly and 29.1 weeks in the Kd 20/27 mg/m 2 twice weekly arm. The safety profile for the once weekly Kd 20/70 mg/m 2 regimen was similar to the twice weekly Kd 20/27 mg/m 2 regimen. Deaths due to adverse reactions within 30 days of last study treatment occurred in 22/238 (9%) patients in the Kd 20/70 mg/m 2 arm and 18/235 (8%) patients in the Kd 20/27 mg/m 2 arm. The most frequent fatal adverse reactions occurring in patients (%) in the two arms (once weekly Kd 20/70 mg/m 2 versus twice weekly Kd 20/27 mg/m 2 ) were sepsis 2 (< 1%) versus 2 (< 1%), septic shock 2 (< 1%) versus 1 (< 1%), and infection 2 (< 1%) versus 0 (0%). Serious adverse reactions were reported in 43% of the patients in the Kd 20/70 mg/m 2 arm and 41% of the patients in the Kd 20/27 mg/m 2 arm. In both arms, pneumonia was the most frequently reported serious adverse reaction (8% versus 7%). Discontinuation due to any adverse reaction occurred in 13% in the Kd 20/70 mg/m 2 arm versus 12% in the Kd 20/27 mg/m 2 arm. The most frequent adverse reaction leading to discontinuation was acute kidney injury (2% versus 2%). The incidence of cardiac failure events was 3.8% in the once weekly Kd 20/70 mg/m 2 arm versus 5.1% in the twice weekly Kd 20/27 mg/m 2 arm.

PLEIADES The safety of Kyprolis in combination with daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj and dexamethasone (DKd) was evaluated in a single-arm cohort of PLEIADES . Patients received Kyprolis as a 30-minute IV infusion once weekly for three weeks (Days 1, 8, and 15), followed by a 13-day rest period (Days 16 to 28) and continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (N=66) in combination with daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj and dexamethasone. Among these patients, 77% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 27% were exposed for greater than one year. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 27% of patients who received Kyprolis in combination with daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj and dexamethasone. Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 3% of patients who received Kyprolis in combination with daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj and dexamethasone. Permanent discontinuation of Kyprolis due to an adverse reaction occurred in 6% of patients who received Kyprolis. Dosage interruptions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 46% of patients who received Kyprolis. The most common adverse reactions (\u226520%) were upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, insomnia, hypertension, diarrhea, cough, dyspnea, headache, pyrexia, nausea and edema peripheral.

The most frequent serious adverse reactions in >5% of patients who received Isa-Kd were pneumonia (25%) and upper respiratory tract infections (9%). Adverse reactions with a fatal outcome during treatment were reported in 3.4% of patients in the Isa-Kd group (those occurring in more than 1% of patients were pneumonia occurring in 1.7% and cardiac failure in 1.1% of patients). Permanent treatment discontinuation due to an adverse reaction (grades 1-4) occurred in 8% of patients who received Isa-Kd. The most frequent adverse reactions requiring permanent discontinuation in patients who received Isa-Kd were infections (2.8%). Dosage interruptions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 4% of patients who received Kyprolis in the Isa-Kd group. The most frequent adverse reactions requiring dosage interruption in patients who received Kyprolis in the Isa-Kd group were administration site extravasation (1.1%) and infusion site extravasation (1.1%). Dose reductions or omissions of Kyprolis due to an adverse reaction in the Isa-Kd group occurred in 67% of patients. Adverse reactions which required dose reductions or omissions in >10% of patients who received Kyprolis in the Isa-Kd group were upper respiratory tract infection (12.4%) and hypertension (11.9%). The most common adverse reactions (\u226520%) were upper respiratory tract infection, infusion-related reactions, fatigue, hypertension, diarrhea, pneumonia, dyspnea, insomnia, bronchitis, cough and back pain.

Premedication with dexamethasone 4 mg was required before each dose in Cycle 1 and was optional for subsequent cycles. The median age was 64 years (range 32\u201387), and approximately 57% were male. The patients received a median of 5 (range 1\u201320) prior regimens. The median number of cycles initiated was 4 (range 1\u201335). Deaths due to adverse reactions within 30 days of the last dose of Kyprolis occurred in 30/598 (5%) patients receiving Kyprolis monotherapy. These adverse reactions were related to cardiac disorders in 10 (2%) patients, infections in 8 (1%) patients, renal disorders in 4 (< 1%) patients, and other adverse reactions in 8 (1%) patients. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 50% of patients in the pooled Kyprolis monotherapy studies (N = 598). The most frequent serious adverse reactions were: pneumonia (8%), acute renal failure (5%), disease progression (4%), pyrexia (3%), hypercalcemia (3%), congestive heart failure (3%), multiple myeloma (3%), anemia (2%), and dyspnea (2%). In FOCUS, a randomized trial comparing Kyprolis as a single agent versus corticosteroids with optional oral cyclophosphamide for patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, mortality was higher in the patients treated with Kyprolis in comparison to the control arm in the subgroup of 48 patients \u2265 75 years of age. The most common cause of discontinuation due to an adverse reaction was acute renal failure (2%). Safety of Kyprolis monotherapy dosed at 20/56 mg/m 2 by 30-minute infusion was evaluated in a multicenter, open-label study in patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma [see Clinical Studies (14.5) ] . The patients received a median of 4 (range 1\u201310) prior regimens. Adverse reactions occurring with Kyprolis monotherapy are presented in Table 19.

The reconstituted solution contains carfilzomib at a concentration of 2 mg/mL. Read the complete preparation instructions prior to reconstitution. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Reconstitution/Preparation Steps : Remove vial from refrigerator just prior to use. Calculate the dose (mg/m 2 ) and number of vials of Kyprolis required using the patient's BSA at baseline. Aseptically reconstitute each Kyprolis vial only with Sterile Water for Injection, USP using the volumes described in Table 6. Use a 21-gauge or larger needle (0.8 mm or smaller external diameter needle) to reconstitute each vial by slowly injecting Sterile Water for Injection through the stopper and directing the Sterile Water for Injection onto the INSIDE WALL OF THE VIAL to minimize foaming. There is no data to support the use of closed system transfer devices with Kyprolis. Table 6: Reconstitution Volumes Strength Amount of Sterile Water for Injection required for reconstitution 10 mg vial 5 mL 30 mg vial 15 mL 60 mg vial 29 mL Gently swirl and/or invert the vial slowly for about 1 minute, or until complete dissolution. DO NOT SHAKE to avoid foam generation. If foaming occurs, allow the solution to settle in the vial until foaming subsides (approximately 5 minutes) and the solution is clear. Visually inspect for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. The reconstituted product should be a clear, colorless solution and should not be administered if any discoloration or particulate matter is observed. Discard any unused portion left in the vial. DO NOT pool unused portions from the vials. DO NOT administer more than one dose from a vial. Administer Kyprolis directly by intravenous infusion or in a 50 mL to 100 mL intravenous bag containing 5% Dextrose Injection . Do not administer as an intravenous push or bolus. When administering in an intravenous bag, use a 21-gauge or larger gauge needle (0.8 mm or smaller external diameter needle) to withdraw the calculated dose from the vial and dilute into 50 mL or 100 mL intravenous bag containing only 5% Dextrose Injection (based on the calculated total dose and infusion time). Flush the intravenous administration line with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection or 5% Dextrose Injection immediately before and after Kyprolis administration. Do not mix Kyprolis with or administer as an infusion with other medicinal products. The stabilities of reconstituted Kyprolis under various temperature and container conditions are shown in Table 7.
