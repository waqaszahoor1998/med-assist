Table 6: Adverse Reactions in the Randomized Metastatic Breast Cancer Study on an Every-3-Weeks Schedule a Paclitaxel injection patients received premedication. b Includes treatment-related events related to hypersensitivity (e.g., flushing, dyspnea, chest pain, hypotension) that began on a day of dosing. c Severe events are defined as at least Grade 3 toxicity. Percent of Patients Paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) 260 mg/m 2 over 30 min (n=229) Paclitaxel Injection 175 mg/m 2 over 3 h a (n=225) Bone Marrow Neutropenia < 2.0 x 10 9 /L 80 82 < 0.5 x 10 9 /L 9 22 Thrombocytopenia < 100 x 10 9 /L 2 3 < 50 x 10 9 /L <1 <1 Anemia < 11 g/dL 33 25 < 8 g/dL 1 <1 Infections 24 20 Febrile Neutropenia 2 1 Neutropenic Sepsis <1 <1 Bleeding 2 2 Hypersensitivity Reaction b All 4 12 Severe c 0 2 Cardiovascular Vital Sign Changes During Administration Bradycardia <1 <1 Hypotension 5 5 Severe Cardiovascular Events c 3 4 Abnormal ECG All Patients 60 52 Patients with Normal Baseline 35 30 Respiratory Cough 7 6 Dyspnea 12 9 Sensory Neuropathy Any Symptoms 71 56 Severe Symptoms c 10 2 Myalgia / Arthralgia Any Symptoms 44 49 Severe Symptoms c 8 4 Asthenia Any Symptoms 47 39 Severe Symptoms c 8 3 Fluid Retention/Edema Any Symptoms 10 8 Severe Symptoms c 0 <1 Gastrointestinal Nausea Any Symptoms 30 22 Severe Symptoms c 3 <1 Vomiting Any Symptoms 18 10 Severe Symptoms c 4 1 Diarrhea Any Symptoms 27 15 Severe Symptoms c <1 1 Mucositis Any Symptoms 7 6 Severe Symptoms c <1 0 Alopecia 90 94 Hepatic (Patients with Normal Baseline) Bilirubin Elevations 7 7 Alkaline Phosphatase Elevations 36 31 AST (SGOT) Elevations 39 32 Injection Site Reaction <1 1 Other Adverse Reactions Hematologic Disorders Neutropenia was dose dependent and reversible. Among patients with metastatic breast cancer in the randomized trial, neutrophil counts declined below 500 cells/mm 3 (Grade 4) in 9% of the patients treated with a dose of 260 mg/m 2 compared to 22% in patients receiving paclitaxel injection at a dose of 175 mg/m 2 . Pancytopenia has been observed in clinical trials. Infections Infectious episodes were reported in 24% of the patients treated with paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound). Oral candidiasis, respiratory tract infections and pneumonia were the most frequently reported infectious complications. Hypersensitivity Reactions (HSRs) Grade 1 or 2 HSRs occurred on the day of paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) administration and consisted of dyspnea (1%) and flushing, hypotension, chest pain, and arrhythmia (all <1%). The use of paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) in patients previously exhibiting hypersensitivity to paclitaxel injection or human albumin has not been studied. Cardiovascular Hypotension, during the 30-minute infusion, occurred in 5% of patients. Bradycardia, during the 30-minute infusion, occurred in <1% of patients. These vital sign changes most often caused no symptoms and required neither specific therapy nor treatment discontinuation. Severe cardiovascular events possibly related to single-agent paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) occurred in approximately 3% of patients. These events included cardiac ischemia/infarction, chest pain, cardiac arrest, supraventricular tachycardia, edema, thrombosis, pulmonary thromboembolism, pulmonary emboli, and hypertension. Cases of cerebrovascular attacks (strokes) and transient ischemic attacks have been reported. Electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities were common among patients at baseline. ECG abnormalities on study did not usually result in symptoms, were not dose-limiting, and required no intervention. ECG abnormalities were noted in 60% of patients. Among patients with a normal ECG prior to study entry, 35% of all patients developed an abnormal tracing while on study. The most frequently reported ECG modifications were non-specific repolarization abnormalities, sinus bradycardia, and sinus tachycardia. Respiratory Dyspnea (12%), cough (7%), and pneumothorax (<1%) were reported after treatment with paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound). Neurologic The frequency and severity of sensory neuropathy increased with cumulative dose. Sensory neuropathy was the cause of paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) discontinuation in 7/229 (3%) patients. Twenty-four patients (10%) treated with paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) developed Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy; of these patients, 14 had documented improvement after a median of 22 days; 10 patients resumed treatment at a reduced dose of paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) and 2 discontinued due to peripheral neuropathy. Of the 10 patients without documented improvement, 4 discontinued the study due to peripheral neuropathy. No Grade 4 sensory neuropathies were reported. Only one incident of motor neuropathy (Grade 2) was observed in either arm of the controlled trial. Vision Disorders Ocular/visual disturbances occurred in 13% of all patients (n=366) treated with paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) and 1% were severe. The severe cases (keratitis and blurred vision) were reported in patients who received higher doses than those recommended (300 or 375 mg/m 2 ). These effects generally have been reversible. Arthralgia/Myalgia The symptoms were usually transient, occurred two or three days after paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) administration, and resolved within a few days. Hepatic Grade 3 or 4 elevations in GGT were reported for 14% of patients treated with paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) and 10% of patients treated with paclitaxel injection in the randomized trial. Renal Overall 11% of patients experienced creatinine elevation, 1% severe. No discontinuations, dose reductions, or dose delays were caused by renal toxicities. Other Clinical Events Nail changes (changes in pigmentation or discoloration of nail bed) have been reported. Edema occurred in 10% of patients; no patients had severe edema. Dehydration and pyrexia were also reported. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Adverse reactions were assessed in 514 paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound)/carboplatin-treated patients and 524 paclitaxel injection/carboplatin-treated patients receiving first-line systemic treatment for locally advanced (stage IIIB) or metastatic (IV) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in a multicenter, randomized, open-label trial. Paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) was administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes at a dose of 100 mg/m 2 on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 21-day cycle. Paclitaxel injection was administered as an intravenous infusion over 3 hours at a dose of 200 mg/m 2 , following premedication. In both treatment arms carboplatin at a dose of AUC = 6 mg\u2022min/mL was administered intravenously on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle after completion of paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound)/paclitaxel infusion. The differences in paclitaxel dose and schedule between the two arms limit direct comparison of dose- and schedule-dependent adverse reactions. Among patients evaluable for adverse reactions, the median age was 60 years, 75% were men, 81% were White, 49% had adenocarcinoma, 43% had squamous cell lung cancer, 76% were ECOG PS 1. Patients in both treatment arms received a median of 6 cycles of treatment. The following common (\u2265 10% incidence) adverse reactions were observed at a similar incidence in paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) plus carboplatin-treated and paclitaxel injection plus carboplatin-treated patients: alopecia 56%, nausea 27%, fatigue 25%, decreased appetite 17%, asthenia 16%, constipation 16%, diarrhea 15%, vomiting 12%, dyspnea 12%, and rash 10% (incidence rates are for the paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) plus carboplatin treatment group). Table 7 provides the frequency and severity of laboratory-detected abnormalities which occurred with a difference of \u2265 5% for all grades (1-4) or \u2265 2% for Grade 3-4 toxicity between paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) plus carboplatin-treated patients or paclitaxel injection plus carboplatin-treated patients.

Grade 3 neuropathy improved to Grade 1 or resolved in 10/17 patients (59%) following interruption or discontinuation of paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound). Adenocarcinoma of the Pancreas Adverse reactions were assessed in 421 patients who received paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) plus gemcitabine and 402 patients who received gemcitabine for the first-line systemic treatment of metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas in a multicenter, multinational, randomized, controlled, open-label trial. Patients received a median treatment duration of 3.9 months in the paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound)/gemcitabine group and 2.8 months in the gemcitabine group. For the treated population, the median relative dose intensity for gemcitabine was 75% in the paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound)/gemcitabine group and 85% in the gemcitabine group. The median relative dose intensity of paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) was 81%.

The median time to first occurrence of Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy in the paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) arm was 140 days. Upon suspension of paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) dosing, the median time to improvement from Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy to \u2264 Grade 1 was 29 days. Of paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound)-treated patients with Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy, 44% resumed paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) at a reduced dose. Sepsis Sepsis occurred in 5% of patients who received paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound)/gemcitabine compared to 2% of patients who received gemcitabine alone. Sepsis occurred both in patients with and without neutropenia. Risk factors for sepsis included biliary obstruction or presence of biliary stent. Pneumonitis Pneumonitis occurred in 4% of patients who received paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound)/gemcitabine compared to 1% of patients who received gemcitabine alone. Two of 17 patients in the paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) arm with pneumonitis died. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) or with paclitaxel injection and may be expected to occur with paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound). Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity Reactions Severe and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions. Cross-hypersensitivity between paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) and other taxanes has been reported. Cardiovascular Congestive heart failure, left ventricular dysfunction, and atrioventricular block. Most patients were previously exposed to cardiotoxic drugs, such as anthracyclines, or had underlying cardiac history. Respiratory Pneumonitis, interstitial pneumonia, and pulmonary embolism Radiation pneumonitis in patients receiving concurrent radiotherapy. Lung fibrosis has been reported with paclitaxel injection. Neurologic Cranial nerve palsies and vocal cord paresis, as well as autonomic neuropathy resulting in paralytic ileus. Vision Disorders Reduced visual acuity due to cystoid macular edema (CME). After cessation of treatment, CME may improve, and visual acuity may return to baseline. Abnormal visual evoked potentials in patients treated with paclitaxel injection suggest persistent optic nerve damage. Hepatic Hepatic necrosis and hepatic encephalopathy leading to death in patients treated with paclitaxel injection. Gastrointestinal (GI) Intestinal obstruction, intestinal perforation, pancreatitis, and ischemic colitis. In patients treated with paclitaxel injection, neutropenic enterocolitis (typhlitis) despite the coadministration of G-CSF, alone and in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. Injection Site Reaction Extravasation. Closely monitor the paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) infusion site for possible infiltration during drug administration [see Dosage and Administration 2.1) ] . Severe events such as phlebitis, cellulitis, induration, necrosis, and fibrosis have been reported with paclitaxel injection. In some cases, the onset of the injection site reaction occurred during a prolonged infusion or was delayed up to ten days. Recurrence of skin reactions at a site of previous extravasation following administration of paclitaxel injection at a different site has been reported. Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders Tumor lysis syndrome Other Clinical Events Skin reactions including generalized or maculopapular rash, erythema, and pruritus Photosensitivity reactions, radiation recall phenomenon, scleroderma, and in some patients previously exposed to capecitabine, reports of palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia. Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported. Conjunctivitis, cellulitis, and increased lacrimation have been reported with paclitaxel injection. Accidental Exposure Upon inhalation of paclitaxel, dyspnea, chest pain, burning eyes, sore throat, and nausea have been reported. Following topical exposure, tingling, burning, and redness have been reported."

Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures. 1 The use of gloves is recommended. If paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) (lyophilized cake or reconstituted suspension) contacts the skin, wash the skin immediately and thoroughly with soap and water. Following topical exposure to paclitaxel, events may include tingling, burning, and redness. If paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) contacts mucous membranes, the membranes should be flushed thoroughly with water. Paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) is supplied as a sterile lyophilized powder for reconstitution before use. Read the entire preparation instructions prior to reconstitution. 1. Aseptically, reconstitute each vial by injecting 20 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. 2. Slowly inject the 20 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, over a minimum of 1 minute, using the sterile syringe to direct the solution flow onto the INSIDE WALL OF THE VIAL. 3. DO NOT INJECT the 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, directly onto the lyophilized cake as this will result in foaming. 4. Once the injection is complete, allow the vial to sit for a minimum of 5 minutes to ensure proper wetting of the lyophilized cake/powder. 5. Gently swirl and/or invert the vial slowly for at least 2 minutes until complete dissolution of any cake/powder occurs. Avoid generation of foam. 6. If foaming or clumping occurs, stand solution for at least 15 minutes until foam subsides. Each mL of the reconstituted formulation will contain 5 mg/mL paclitaxel. The reconstituted suspension should be milky and homogenous without visible particulates. If particulates or settling are visible, the vial should be gently inverted again to ensure complete resuspension prior to use. Discard the reconstituted suspension if precipitates are observed. Discard any unused portion. Calculate the exact total dosing volume of 5 mg/mL suspension required for the patient and slowly withdraw the dosing volume of the reconstituted suspension from the vial(s) into a syringe: Dosing volume (mL)=Total dose (mg)/5 (mg/mL). Inject the appropriate amount of reconstituted paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) into an empty, sterile intravenous bag [plasticized polyvinyl chloride (PVC) containers, PVC or non-PVC type intravenous bag]. The use of specialized DEHP-free solution containers or administration sets is not necessary to prepare or administer paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) infusions. The use of medical devices containing silicone oil as a lubricant (i.e., syringes and intravenous bags) to reconstitute and administer paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) may result in the formation of proteinaceous strands. Visually inspect the reconstituted paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) suspension in the intravenous bag prior to administration. Discard the reconstituted suspension if proteinaceous strands, particulate matter, or discoloration are observed. Slowly inject the 20 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, over a minimum of 1 minute, using the sterile syringe to direct the solution flow onto the INSIDE WALL OF THE VIAL. 2.8 Stability Unopened vials of paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) are stable until the date indicated on the package when stored between 20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C (68\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F) in the original package. Neither freezing nor refrigeration adversely affects the stability of the product. Stability of Reconstituted Suspension in the Vial Reconstituted paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) in the vial should be used immediately, but may be refrigerated at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) for a maximum of 24 hours if necessary. If not used immediately, each vial of reconstituted suspension should be replaced in the original carton to protect it from bright light. Discard any unused portion. Stability of Reconstituted Suspension in the Infusion Bag The suspension for infusion when prepared as recommended in an infusion bag should be used immediately, but may be refrigerated at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) and protected from bright light for a maximum of 24 hours. The total combined refrigerated storage time of reconstituted paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound) in the vial and in the infusion bag is 24 hours. This may be followed by storage in the infusion bag at ambient temperature (approximately 25\u00b0C) and lighting conditions for a maximum of 4 hours. Discard any unused portion."
