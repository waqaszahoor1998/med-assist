    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Avoid concomitant administration of ZELBORAF with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers. ( 7.1 ) CYP1A2 Substrates: ZELBORAF can increase concentrations of CYP1A2 substrates. Avoid concomitant use of ZELBORAF with CYP1A2 substrates with a narrow therapeutic window. If coadministration cannot be avoided, monitor closely for toxicities and consider dose reduction of CYP1A2 substrates. ( 7.2 ). 7.1 Effect of Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors or Inducers on Vemurafenib Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Coadministration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor increased vemurafenib plasma concentrations and may lead to increased toxicity. Avoid coadministration of ZELBORAF with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. If coadministration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is unavoidable, consider dose reduction of ZELBORAF, if clinically indicated. [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Coadministration of ZELBORAF with rifampin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, decreased vemurafenib plasma concentrations and may result in decreased efficacy. Avoid coadministration of ZELBORAF with strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin), and replace these drugs with alternative drugs when possible. If coadministration of a strong CYP3A4 inducer is unavoidable, increase the dose of ZELBORAF by 240 mg (one tablet) as tolerated [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.2 Effect of Vemurafenib on CYP1A2 Substrates Coadministration of ZELBORAF with tizanidine, a sensitive CYP1A2 substrate, increased tizanidine systemic exposure by 4.7-fold. Avoid concomitant use of ZELBORAF with drugs having a narrow therapeutic window that are predominantly metabolized by CYP1A2 [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . If coadministration cannot be avoided, monitor closely for toxicities and consider a dose reduction of concomitant CYP1A2 substrates. 7.3 Concurrent Ipilimumab Increases in transaminases and bilirubin occurred in a majority of patients who received concurrent ipilimumab and ZELBORAF [see Warnings and Precautions Section 5.6 ]. 7.4 Effect of Vemurafenib on P-gp Substrates Coadministration of ZELBORAF with digoxin, a sensitive P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate, increased digoxin systemic exposure by 1.8-fold. Avoid concurrent use of P-gp substrates known to have narrow therapeutic indices. If use of these medications is unavoidable, consider dose reduction of P-gp substrates with narrow therapeutic indices."

Unresectable or Metastatic Melanoma with BRAF V600E Mutation This section describes adverse drug reactions (ADRs) identified from analyses of Trial 1 and Trial 2 [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Trial 1 randomized (1:1) 675 treatment-naive patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma to receive ZELBORAF 960 mg orally twice daily or dacarbazine 1000 mg/m 2 intravenously every 3 weeks. In Trial 2, 132 patients with metastatic melanoma and failure of at least one prior systemic therapy received treatment with ZELBORAF 960 mg orally twice daily. Table 1 presents adverse reactions reported in at least 10% of unresectable or metastatic melanoma patients treated with ZELBORAF. The most common adverse reactions of any grade (\u2265 30% in either study) in ZELBORAF-treated patients were arthralgia, rash, alopecia, fatigue, photosensitivity reaction, nausea, pruritus, and skin papilloma. The most common (\u2265 5%) Grade 3 adverse reactions were cuSCC and rash. The incidence of Grade 4 adverse reactions was \u2264 4% in both studies. The incidence of adverse events resulting in permanent discontinuation of study medication in Trial 1 was 7% for the ZELBORAF arm and 4% for the dacarbazine arm. In Trial 2, the incidence of adverse events resulting in permanent discontinuation of study medication was 3% in ZELBORAF-treated patients. The median duration of study treatment was 4.2 months for ZELBORAF and 0.8 months for dacarbazine in Trial 1, and 5.7 months for ZELBORAF in Trial 2.

    "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Confirm the presence of BRAF V600E mutation in tumor specimens prior to initiation of treatment with ZELBORAF. ( 2.1 ) Recommended dose: 960 mg orally twice daily taken approximately 12 hours apart with or without a meal. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Patient Selection for Treatment of Melanoma Confirm the presence of BRAF V600E mutation in melanoma tumor specimens prior to initiation of treatment with ZELBORAF [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Information on FDA-approved tests for the detection of BRAF V600 mutations in melanoma is available at http://www.fda.gov/CompanionDiagnostics. 2.2 Recommended Dose The recommended dose of ZELBORAF is 960 mg (four 240 mg tablets) orally every 12 hours with or without a meal. A missed dose can be taken up to 4 hours prior to the next dose. Treat patients with ZELBORAF until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. Do not take an additional dose if vomiting occurs after ZELBORAF administration, but continue with the next scheduled dose. Do not crush or chew the tablets. 2.3 Dose Modifications For New Primary Cutaneous Malignancies: No dose modifications are recommended. For Other Adverse Reactions: Permanently discontinue ZELBORAF for any of the following: Grade 4 adverse reaction, first appearance (if clinically appropriate) or second appearance QTc prolongation > 500 ms and increased by > 60 ms from pre-treatment values [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Withhold ZELBORAF for NCI-CTCAE (v4.0) intolerable Grade 2 or greater adverse reactions. Upon recovery to Grade 0\u20131, restart ZELBORAF at a reduced dose as follows: 720 mg twice daily for first appearance of intolerable Grade 2 or Grade 3 adverse reactions 480 mg twice daily for second appearance of Grade 2 (if intolerable) or Grade 3 adverse reactions or for first appearance of Grade 4 adverse reaction (if clinically appropriate) Do not dose reduce to below 480 mg twice daily. 2.4 Dose Modification for Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers during treatment with ZELBORAF [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . If concomitant use of a strong CYP3A4 inducer is unavoidable, increase the dose of ZELBORAF by 240 mg (one tablet) as tolerated. After discontinuation of a strong CYP3A4 inducer for two weeks, resume the ZELBORAF dose that was taken prior to initiating the strong CYP3A4 inducer."
