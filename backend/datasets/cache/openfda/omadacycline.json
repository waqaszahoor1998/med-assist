    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described in greater detail in the Warnings and Precautions section of labeling: Mortality Imbalance in Patients with Community-Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Tooth Development and Enamel Hypoplasia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Inhibition of Bone Growth [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Tetracycline Class Effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6 )] The most common adverse reactions (incidence \u22652%) are nausea, vomiting, infusion site reactions, alanine aminotransferase increased, aspartate aminotransferase increased, gamma-glutamyl transferase increased, hypertension, headache, diarrhea, insomnia, and constipation. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Paratek Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-833-727-2835 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Overview of the Safety Evaluation of NUZYRA NUZYRA was evaluated in three Phase 3 clinical trials (Trial 1, Trial 2 and Trial 3). These trials included a single Phase 3 trial in CABP patients (Trial 1) and two Phase 3 trials in ABSSSI patients (Trial 2 and Trial 3). Across all Phase 3 trials, a total of 1073 patients were treated with NUZYRA (382 patients in Trial 1 and 691 in Trials 2 and 3 of which 368 patients were treated with only oral NUZYRA). Clinical Trial Experience in Patients with Community-Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia Trial 1 was a Phase 3 CABP trial that enrolled 774 adult patients, 386 randomized to NUZYRA (382 received at least one dose of NUZYRA and 4 patients did not receive the study drug) and 388 randomized to moxifloxacin (all 388 received at least one dose of moxifloxacin). The mean age of patients treated with NUZYRA was 61 years (range 19 to 97 years) and 42% were greater than or equal to 65 years of age. Overall, patients treated with NUZYRA were predominantly male (53.7%), white (92.4%), and had a mean body mass index (BMI) of 27.3 kg/m 2 . Approximately 47% of NUZYRA treated patients had CrCl <90 ml/min. Patients were administered an IV to oral switch dosage regimen of NUZYRA. The total treatment duration was 7 to 14 days. Mean duration of IV treatment was 5.7 days and mean total duration of treatment was 9.6 days in both treatment arms. Imbalance in Mortality In Trial 1, eight deaths (2%) occurred in 382 patients treated with NUZYRA as compared to four deaths (1%) in 388 patients treated with moxifloxacin. All deaths, in both treatment arms, occurred in patients >65 years of age. The causes of death varied and included worsening and/or complications of infection and underlying conditions. The cause of the mortality imbalance has not been established [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Serious Adverse Reactions and Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation In Trial 1, a total of 23/382 (6.0%) patients treated with NUZYRA and 26/388 (6.7%) patients treated with moxifloxacin experienced serious adverse reactions. Discontinuation of treatment due to any adverse reactions occurred in 21/382 (5.5%) patients treated with NUZYRA and 27/388 (7.0%) patients treated with moxifloxacin. Most Common Adverse Reactions Table 4 lists the most common adverse reactions occurring in \u22652% of patients receiving NUZYRA in Trial 1.

Trial 3 was a Phase 3 ABSSSI trial that enrolled 735 adult patients, 368 randomized to NUZYRA and 367 randomized to linezolid. In Trial 2 (IV to oral switch trial), the mean age of patients treated with NUZYRA was 47 years (range 19 to 88). Overall, patients treated with NUZYRA were predominantly male (62.8%), white (91.0%) and had a mean BMI of 28.1 kg/m 2 . In Trial 3 (oral only trial), the mean age of patients was 43 years (range 18 to 86). Patients treated with NUZYRA were predominantly male (65.8%), white (88.9%), and had a mean BMI of 27.9 kg/m 2 . In Trials 2 and 3, approximately 12% of NUZYRA treated patients had CrCl <90 ml/min. Overall, the mean and median calculated lesion area was similar across both trials. Trial 2 required at least 3 days of IV treatment followed by switch to oral regimen based on physician's discretion. Mean duration of IV treatment in Trial 2 was 4 days and mean total duration of treatment was 9 days in both treatment arms. In Trial 3, only oral therapy was administered, and mean total duration of treatment was 8 days in both treatment arms. The median days on treatment in the pooled ABSSSI trials was 9 days for both NUZYRA and linezolid. Serious Adverse Reactions and Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation In the pooled ABSSSI trials, serious adverse reactions occurred in 16/691 (2.3%) of patients treated with NUZYRA and 13/689 (1.9%) of patients treated with comparator. Discontinuation of treatment due to adverse events occurred in 12 (1.7%) NUZYRA treated patients, and 10 (1.5%) comparator treated patients. There was 1 death (0.1%) reported in NUZYRA treated patients and 3 deaths (0.4%) reported in linezolid patients in ABSSSI trials. Most Common Adverse Reactions Table 5 includes the most common adverse reactions occurring in \u22652% of patients receiving NUZYRA in Trials 2 and 3.

To prepare the required dose for intravenous infusion, reconstitute and dilute the appropriate number of vials, as determined from Table 3 below. Reconstitute each 100 mg vial of NUZYRA with 5 mL of Sterile Water, 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, or 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, for Injection. Gently swirl the contents and let the vial stand until the cake has completely dissolved and any foam disperses. Do not shake the vial. The reconstituted NUZYRA solution should be yellow to dark orange in color; if not, the solution should be discarded. Visually inspect the reconstituted NUZYRA solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to further dilution and administration. If necessary, invert the vial to dissolve any remaining powder and swirl gently to prevent foaming. Immediately (within 1 hour), withdraw 5 mL or 10 mL of the reconstituted solution and further dilute to a 100 mL (nominal volume) of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, or 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, bag for injection. The concentration of the final diluted infusion solution will either be 1 mg/mL or 2 mg/mL in accordance with Table 3 below. Discard any unused portion of the reconstituted solution. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Table 3: Preparation of NUZYRA Intravenous Infusion NUZYRA for Injection Dose Number of Vials to Reconstitute for Further Dilution Volume of Reconstituted Solution (5 mL/vial) to Withdraw for Further Dilution Final Infusion Concentration of NUZYRA 200 mg 2 Vials 10 mL 2 mg/mL 100 mg 1 Vial 5 mL 1 mg/mL Storage of the Diluted Infusion Solution The NUZYRA diluted infusion solution may be used within 24 hours at room temperature (less than or equal to 25\u00b0C) or within 7 days when refrigerated (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C). Do not freeze. Allow the infusion bag to reach room temperature prior to use. Administration After reconstitution and dilution, administer NUZYRA by intravenous infusion, using a total infusion time of 60 minutes for a 200 mg dose, or a total infusion time of 30 minutes for a 100 mg dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.3) ] . Administer NUZYRA intravenously through a dedicated line or through a Y-site. If the same intravenous line is used for sequential infusion of several drugs, the line should be flushed with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, or 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, before and after infusion of NUZYRA. The compatibility of NUZYRA with other drugs and infusion solutions other than 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP has not been established."
