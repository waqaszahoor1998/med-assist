    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022 Combined P-gp and Strong CYP3A Inducers: Avoid concomitant use. ( 7.1 ) \u2022 Strong CYP3A Inhibitors: Consider alternative therapies. If the concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors cannot be avoided, monitor patients more frequently for XOSPATA adverse reactions. ( 2.3 , 7.1 ) \u2022 P-gp, BCRP, OCT1 Substrates: Decrease the dose of the substrates when coadministered with gilteritinib and as clinically indicated. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on XOSPATA Combined P-gp and Strong CYP3A Inducers Concomitant use of XOSPATA with a combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inducer decreases gilteritinib exposure which may decrease XOSPATA efficacy [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Avoid concomitant use of XOSPATA with combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inducers. Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Concomitant use of XOSPATA with a strong CYP3A inhibitor increases gilteritinib exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Consider alternative therapies that are not strong CYP3A inhibitors. If the concomitant use of these inhibitors is considered essential for the care of the patient, monitor patient more frequently for XOSPATA adverse reactions. Interrupt and reduce XOSPATA dosage in patients with serious or life-threatening toxicity [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . 7.2 Effect of XOSPATA on Other Drugs Drugs that Target 5HT2B Receptor or Sigma Nonspecific Receptor Concomitant use of gilteritinib may reduce the effects of drugs that target the 5HT 2B receptor or the sigma nonspecific receptor (e.g., escitalopram, fluoxetine, sertraline). Avoid concomitant use of these drugs with XOSPATA unless their use is considered essential for the care of the patient [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . P-gp, BCRP, and OCT1 Substrates Based on in vitro data, gilteritinib is a P-gp, breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP), and organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1) inhibitor. Coadministration of gilteritinib may increase the exposure of P-gp, BCRP, and OCT1 substrates, which may increase the incidence and severity of adverse reactions of these substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. For P-gp, BCRP, or OCT1 substrates where small concentration changes may lead to serious adverse reactions, decrease the dose or modify the dosing frequency of such substrate and monitor for adverse reactions as recommended in the respective prescribing information."

    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: \u2022 Differentiation syndrome [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] \u2022 Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] \u2022 Prolonged QT interval [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] \u2022 Pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] The most common adverse reactions (\u226520%) are transaminase increased, myalgia/arthralgia, fatigue/malaise, fever, mucositis, edema, rash, noninfectious diarrhea, dyspnea, nausea, cough, constipation, eye disorders, headache, dizziness, hypotension, vomiting, and renal impairment. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Astellas Pharma US, Inc. at 1-800-727-7003 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety profile of XOSPATA is based on 319 patients with relapsed or refractory AML treated with gilteritinib 120 mg daily in three clinical trials. The median duration of exposure to XOSPATA was 3.6 months (range 0.1 to 43.4 months). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 2% of patients receiving XOSPATA. These included cardiac arrest (1%) and one case each of differentiation syndrome and pancreatitis. The most frequent (\u22655%) nonhematological serious adverse reactions reported in patients were fever (13%), dyspnea (9%), renal impairment (8%), transaminase increased (6%) and noninfectious diarrhea (5%). Of the 319 patients, 91 (29%) required a dose interruption due to an adverse reaction; the most common adverse reactions leading to dose interruption were aspartate aminotransferase increased (6%), alanine aminotransferase increased (6%) and fever (4%). Twenty patients (6%) required a dose reduction due to an adverse reaction. Twenty-two (7%) discontinued XOSPATA treatment permanently due to an adverse reaction. The most common (>1%) adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were aspartate aminotransferase increased (2%) and alanine aminotransferase increased (2%). Overall, for the 319 patients, the most frequent (\u226510%) all-grade nonhematological adverse reactions reported in patients were transaminase increased (51%), myalgia/arthralgia (50%), fatigue/malaise (44%), fever (41%), mucositis (41%), edema (40%), rash (36%), noninfectious diarrhea (35%), dyspnea (35%), nausea (30%), cough (28%), constipation (28%), eye disorders (25%), headache (24%), dizziness (22%), hypotension (22%), vomiting (21%), renal impairment (21%), abdominal pain (18%), neuropathy (18%), insomnia (15%) and dysgeusia (11%). The most frequent (\u22655%) grade \u22653 nonhematological adverse reactions reported in patients were transaminase increased (21%), dyspnea (12%), hypotension (7%), mucositis (7%), myalgia/arthralgia (7%), and fatigue/malaise (6%). Shifts to grades 3-4 nonhematologic laboratory abnormalities included phosphate decreased 42/309 (14%), alanine aminotransferase increased 41/317 (13%), sodium decreased 37/314 (12%), aspartate aminotransferase increased 33/317 (10%), calcium decreased 19/312 (6%), creatine kinase increased 20/317 (6%), triglycerides increased 18/310 (6%), creatinine increased 10/316 (3%), and alkaline phosphatase increased 5/317 (2%).

  "dosage_administration": [
    "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 120 mg orally once daily. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Patient Selection Select patients for the treatment of AML with XOSPATA based on the presence of FLT3 mutations in the blood or bone marrow [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. Information on FDA-approved tests for the detection of a FLT3 mutation in AML is available at http://www.fda.gov/CompanionDiagnostics . 2.2 Recommended Dosage The recommended starting dose of XOSPATA is 120 mg orally once daily with or without food. Response may be delayed. In the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, treatment for a minimum of 6 months is recommended to allow time for a clinical response. Do not break or crush XOSPATA tablets. Administer XOSPATA tablets orally about the same time each day. If a dose of XOSPATA is missed or not taken at the usual time, administer the dose as soon as possible on the same day, and at least 12 hours prior to the next scheduled dose. Return to the normal schedule the following day. Do not administer 2 doses within 12 hours. 2.3 Dosage Modifications Assess blood counts and blood chemistries, including creatine phosphokinase, prior to the initiation of XOSPATA, at least once weekly for the first month, once every other week for the second month, and once monthly for the duration of therapy. Perform electrocardiogram (ECG) prior to initiation of treatment with gilteritinib, on days 8 and 15 of cycle 1, and prior to the start of the next two subsequent cycles. Interrupt dosing or reduce dose for toxicities as per Table 1 . Table 1: Dosage Modifications for XOSPATA-Related Toxicities Grade 1 is mild, Grade 2 is moderate, Grade 3 is serious, Grade 4 is life-threatening. Adverse Reaction Recommended Action Differentiation Syndrome \u2022 If differentiation syndrome is suspected, administer systemic corticosteroids and initiate hemodynamic monitoring until symptom resolution and for a minimum of 3 days [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . \u2022 Interrupt XOSPATA if severe signs and/or symptoms persist for more than 48 hours after initiation of corticosteroids [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . \u2022 Resume XOSPATA when signs and symptoms improve to Grade 2 or lower. Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome \u2022 Discontinue XOSPATA. QTc interval greater than 500 msec \u2022 Interrupt XOSPATA. \u2022 Resume XOSPATA at 80 mg when QTc interval returns to within 30 msec of baseline or less than or equal to 480 msec. QTc interval increased by >30 msec on ECG on day 8 of cycle 1 \u2022 Confirm with ECG on day 9. \u2022 If confirmed, consider dose reduction to 80 mg. Pancreatitis \u2022 Interrupt XOSPATA until pancreatitis is resolved. \u2022 Resume XOSPATA at 80 mg. Other Grade 3 or higher toxicity considered related to treatment. \u2022 Interrupt XOSPATA until toxicity resolves or improves to Grade 1 . \u2022 Resume XOSPATA at 80 mg."
