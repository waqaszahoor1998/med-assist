    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Closely monitor for adverse reactions during concomitant use of SCEMBLIX at 200 mg twice daily. ( 7.1 ) Itraconazole Oral Solution Containing Hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin: Avoid concomitant use of SCEMBLIX at all recommended doses. ( 7.1 ) Certain Substrates of CYP3A4: Closely monitor for adverse reactions during concomitant use of SCEMBLIX at 80 mg total daily dose. Avoid use of SCEMBLIX at 200 mg twice daily. ( 7.2 ) Substrates of CYP2C9: Avoid concomitant use of SCEMBLIX at all recommended doses. 80 mg total daily dose: If unavoidable, reduce the CYP2C9 substrate dosage as necessary. ( 7.2 ) 200 mg twice daily: If unavoidable, consider alternative therapy with non-CYP2C9 substrate. ( 7.2 ) Certain P-gp Substrates: Closely monitor for adverse reactions during concomitant use of SCEMBLIX at all recommended doses. ( 7.2 ) Substrates of OATP1B or BCRP: Avoid concomitant use with rosuvastatin and atorvastatin at all recommended doses. Closely monitor for adverse reactions of other OATP1B or BCRP substrates during concomitant use of SCEMBLIX at all recommended doses. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on SCEMBLIX Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Asciminib is a CYP3A4 substrate. Concomitant use of SCEMBLIX with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor increases both the asciminib C max and AUC, which may increase the risk of adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Closely monitor for adverse reactions in patients treated with SCEMBLIX at 200 mg twice daily with concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. Itraconazole Oral Solution Containing Hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin Concomitant use of SCEMBLIX with itraconazole oral solution containing hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin decreases asciminib C max and AUC, which may reduce SCEMBLIX efficacy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Avoid coadministration of SCEMBLIX at all recommended doses with itraconazole oral solution containing hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin. 7.2 Effect of SCEMBLIX on Other Drugs Certain CYP3A4 Substrates Asciminib is a CYP3A4 inhibitor. Concomitant use of SCEMBLIX increases the C max and AUC of CYP3A4 substrates, which may increase the risk of adverse reactions of these substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Closely monitor for adverse reactions in patients treated with SCEMBLIX at 80 mg total daily dose with concomitant use of certain CYP3A4 substrates, where minimal concentration changes may lead to serious adverse reactions. Avoid coadministration of SCEMBLIX at 200 mg twice daily with certain CYP3A4 substrates, where minimal concentration changes may lead to serious adverse reactions. CYP2C9 Substrates Asciminib is a CYP2C9 inhibitor. Concomitant use of SCEMBLIX increases the C max and AUC of CYP2C9 substrates, which may increase the risk of adverse reactions of these substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Avoid coadministration of SCEMBLIX at 80 mg total daily dose with certain CYP2C9 substrates, where minimal concentration changes may lead to serious adverse reactions. If coadministration is unavoidable, reduce the CYP2C9 substrate dosage as recommended in its prescribing information. Avoid coadministration of SCEMBLIX at 200 mg twice daily with sensitive CYP2C9 substrates and certain CYP2C9 substrates, where minimal concentration changes may lead to serious adverse reactions. If coadministration is unavoidable, consider alternative therapy with a non-CYP2C9 substrate. Certain P-gp Substrates Asciminib is a P-gp inhibitor. Concomitant use of SCEMBLIX increases the plasma concentrations of P-gp substrates, which may increase the risk of adverse reactions of these substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Closely monitor for adverse reactions in patients treated with SCEMBLIX at all recommended doses with concomitant use of P-gp substrates, where minimal concentration changes may lead to serious toxicities. Substrates of OATP1B or BCRP Asciminib is an OATP1B and BCRP inhibitor. The effect of concomitant use of SCEMBLIX with OATP1B and BCRP substrates has not been established in clinical studies. However, based upon a mechanistic understanding of the elimination of asciminib and its in vitro inhibitory potential [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] , concomitant use of SCEMBLIX increases the C max and AUC of OATP1B and BCRP substrates, which may increase the risk of adverse reactions of these substrates. Avoid coadministration of SCEMBLIX at all recommended doses with rosuvastatin and atorvastatin. Closely monitor for adverse reactions in patients treated with SCEMBLIX at all recommended doses with concomitant use of other OATP1B or BCRP substrates. Reduce the dosage of the other OATP1B or BCRP substrates as recommended in their Prescribing Information when used concomitantly with SCEMBLIX at all recommended doses."

( 6.1 ) Most common select laboratory abnormalities (\u2265 20%) are lymphocyte count decreased, leukocyte count decreased, platelet count decreased, neutrophil count decreased, calcium corrected decreased, lipase increased, cholesterol increased, uric acid increased, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) increased, hemoglobin decreased, triglycerides increased, creatine kinase increased, amylase increased, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation at 1-888-669-6682 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflect exposure to SCEMBLIX at 10 mg to 200 mg orally twice daily (between 0.25 to 5 times the recommended dosage for the 80 mg daily dosage and between 0.05 times and up to the recommended dosage for the 200 mg twice daily dosage) in 556 patients enrolled in one of three clinical trials, including patients with Ph+ CML in CP receiving SCEMBLIX as monotherapy: study CABL001J12301 (ASC4FIRST), study CABL001A2301 (ASCEMBL) and study CABL001X2101 [see Clinical Studies (14)] . Among the 556 patients receiving SCEMBLIX, the median duration of exposure to SCEMBLIX was 83 weeks (range, 0.1 to 439 weeks), with 79% of patients exposed for at least 48 weeks and 42% of patients exposed for at least 96 weeks, respectively. The most common (\u2265 20%) adverse reactions in patients who received SCEMBLIX were musculoskeletal pain, rash, fatigue, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, abdominal pain, and diarrhea.

Adverse reactions which required dosage interruption in > 5% of patients included thrombocytopenia (13%) and neutropenia (10%). Dose reductions of SCEMBLIX due to an adverse reaction occurred in 6% of patients. Adverse reactions which required dose reductions in > 1% of patients included thrombocytopenia (2.5%) and neutropenia (1.5%). The most common (\u2265 20%) adverse reaction in patients who received SCEMBLIX was musculoskeletal pain. The most common select laboratory abnormalities that worsened from baseline in \u2265 20% of patients who received SCEMBLIX were lymphocyte count decreased, leukocyte count decreased, platelet count decreased, neutrophil count decreased, calcium corrected decreased, lipase increased, cholesterol increased, uric acid increased, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) increased, hemoglobin decreased, and triglycerides increased.
