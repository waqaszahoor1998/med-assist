    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Combined P-gp and Strong or Moderate CYP3A Inducers : Avoid concomitant use. ( 7.1 ) Combined P-gp and Strong CYP3A Inhibitors : Monitor patients more frequently for NUBEQA adverse reactions. ( 7.1 ) BCRP Substrates : Avoid concomitant use with drugs that are BCRP substrates where possible. If used together, monitor patients more frequently for adverse reactions and consider dose reduction of the BCRP substrate drug. ( 7.2 ) OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 Substrates : Concomitant use of NUBEQA may increase the plasma concentrations of OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 substrates. If used together, monitor patients more frequently for adverse reactions and consider dose reduction of these drugs. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on NUBEQA Combined P-gp and Strong or Moderate CYP3A4 Inducer Concomitant use of NUBEQA with a combined P-gp and strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducer decreases darolutamide exposure which may decrease NUBEQA activity [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Avoid concomitant use of NUBEQA with combined P-gp and strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers. Combined P-gp and Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Concomitant use of NUBEQA with a combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitor increases darolutamide exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] which may increase the risk of NUBEQA adverse reactions . Monitor patients more frequently for NUBEQA adverse reactions and modify NUBEQA dosage as needed [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 7.2 Effects of NUBEQA on Other Drugs Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) and Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptides (OATP) 1B1 and 1B3 Substrates NUBEQA is an inhibitor of BCRP transporter. Concomitant use of NUBEQA increases the AUC and C max of BCRP substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ], which may increase the risk of BCRP substrate-related toxicities. Avoid concomitant use with drugs that are BCRP substrates where possible. If used together, monitor patients more frequently for adverse reactions, and consider dose reduction of the BCRP substrate drug. NUBEQA is an inhibitor of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 transporters. Concomitant use of NUBEQA may increase the plasma concentrations of OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 substrates. Monitor patients more frequently for adverse reactions of these drugs and consider dose reduction while patients are taking NUBEQA [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] , Review the prescribing information of the BCRP, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 substrates when used concomitantly with NUBEQA."

The pooled data in WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS reflect two randomized clinical trials [ARAMIS, ARANOTE] in patients with nmCRPC (N = 954) and mCSPC (N = 445) treated with NUBEQA. In these trials, the median duration of treatment was 18.2 months (range 0.03 to 44.3) for patients who received NUBEQA [ see Clinical Studies (14) ]. In this pooled safety population, the most common adverse reactions (>10% with a \u22652% increase over placebo), including laboratory test abnormalities were increased AST, decreased neutrophil count, increased bilirubin, fatigue and increased ALT. The safety of NUBEQA in combination with docetaxel in mCSPC is based on data from 1302 patients of whom 652 received at least one dose of NUBEQA in the ARASENS study [ see Clinical Studies (14) ]. Non-Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer ARAMIS The safety of NUBEQA in nmCRPC patients was evaluated in ARAMIS, a randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center clinical study [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Patients received either NUBEQA at a dose of 600 mg, or a placebo, twice a day. All patients in the ARAMIS study received a concomitant gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog or had a bilateral orchiectomy. Among patients who received NUBEQA, the median duration of exposure was 14.8 months (range: 0 to 44.3 months). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 25% of patients receiving NUBEQA and in 20% of patients receiving placebo. Serious adverse reactions in \u22651% of patients who received NUBEQA included urinary retention, pneumonia and hematuria. Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 3.9% of patients receiving NUBEQA and 3.2% of patients receiving placebo. Fatal adverse reactions that occurred in \u22652 patients who received NUBEQA included death (0.4%), cardiac failure (0.3%), cardiac arrest (0.2%), general physical health deterioration (0.2%), and pulmonary embolism (0.2%). Permanent discontinuation of NUBEQA due to adverse reactions occurred in 9% of patients receiving NUBEQA. The most common adverse reactions requiring permanent discontinuation in patients who received NUBEQA included cardiac failure (0.4%), and death (0.4%). Dosage interruptions due to adverse reactions occurred in 13% of patients treated with NUBEQA.

    "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended Dosage : NUBEQA 600 mg (two 300 mg tablets) administered orally twice daily. Swallow tablets whole. Take NUBEQA with food. ( 2.1 ) For patients with mCSPC treated with NUBEQA in combination with docetaxel, administer the first cycle of docetaxel within 6 weeks after the start of NUBEQA treatment. ( 2.1 ) Patients should also receive a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist concurrently or have had bilateral orchiectomy. ( 2.1 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosage The recommended dose of NUBEQA is 600 mg (two 300 mg tablets) taken orally, twice daily, with food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Continue treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. Patients receiving NUBEQA should also receive a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist concurrently or have had a bilateral orchiectomy. When used in combination with docetaxel for mCSPC, administer the first of 6 cycles of docetaxel within 6 weeks after the start of NUBEQA treatment. Refer to docetaxel prescribing information for additional dosing information, including dosage modifications. Treatment with NUBEQA may be continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, even if a cycle of docetaxel is delayed, interrupted, or discontinued [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Advise patients to swallow tablets whole with food, to take any missed dose as soon as they remember prior to the next scheduled dose, and not to take two doses together to make up for a missed dose. 2.2 Dosage Modification If a patient experiences a greater than or equal to Grade 3 or an intolerable adverse reaction, withhold NUBEQA or reduce dosage to 300 mg twice daily until symptoms improve. NUBEQA may be resumed at a dose of 600 mg twice daily, when adverse reaction returns to baseline [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Dosage reduction below 300 mg twice daily is not recommended. For patients who experience ischemic heart disease or seizure, additional dose modifications may be required [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 and 5.2) ]. 2.3 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Severe Renal Impairment For patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15\u201329 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) not receiving hemodialysis, the recommended dose of NUBEQA is 300 mg twice daily [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.4 Recommended Dosage in Patients with Moderate Hepatic Impairment For patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B), the recommended dose of NUBEQA is 300 mg twice daily [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."
