The data in the Warnings and Precautions reflect exposure to LENVIMA as a single agent in 261 patients with DTC (SELECT) and 476 patients with HCC (REFLECT), LENVIMA with pembrolizumab in 406 patients with endometrial carcinoma (Study 309), LENVIMA with everolimus in 62 patients with RCC (Study 205), and LENVIMA with pembrolizumab in 352 patients with RCC (CLEAR). Safety data obtained in 1823 patients with advanced solid tumors who received LENVIMA as a single agent across multiple clinical studies was used to further characterize the risks of serious adverse reactions. Among the 1823 patients who received LENVIMA as a single agent, the median age was 61 years (20 to 89 years), the dose range was 0.2 mg to 32 mg daily, and the median duration of exposure was 5.6 months. The data below reflect exposure to LENVIMA in 1557 patients enrolled in randomized, active-controlled trials (REFLECT; Study 205; CLEAR; Study 309), and a randomized, placebo-controlled trial (SELECT). The median duration of exposure to LENVIMA across these five studies ranged from 6 to 16 months. The demographic and exposure data for each clinical trial population are described in the subsections below. Differentiated Thyroid Cancer The safety of LENVIMA was evaluated in SELECT, in which patients with radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer were randomized (2:1) to LENVIMA (n=261) or placebo (n=131) [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 ) ] . The median treatment duration was 16.1 months for LENVIMA. Among 261 patients who received LENVIMA, median age was 64 years, 52% were females, 80% were White, 18% were Asian, and 2% were Black; and 4% were Hispanic/Latino. The most common adverse reactions observed in LENVIMA-treated patients (\u226530%) were, in order of decreasing frequency, hypertension, fatigue, diarrhea, arthralgia/myalgia, decreased appetite, decreased weight, nausea, stomatitis, headache, vomiting, proteinuria, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE) syndrome, abdominal pain, and dysphonia. The most common serious adverse reactions (at least 2%) were pneumonia (4%), hypertension (3%), and dehydration (3%). Adverse reactions led to dose reductions in 68% of patients receiving LENVIMA; 18% of patients discontinued LENVIMA for adverse reactions. The most common adverse reactions (at least 10%) resulting in dose reductions of LENVIMA were hypertension (13%), proteinuria (11%), decreased appetite (10%), and diarrhea (10%); the most common adverse reactions (at least 1%) resulting in discontinuation of LENVIMA were hypertension (1%) and asthenia (1%). Table 3 presents adverse reactions occurring at a higher rate in LENVIMA-treated patients than patients receiving placebo in the double-blind phase of the study.

LENVIMA with Everolimus (n = 62), Everolimus (n = 50). Hepatocellular Carcinoma The safety of LENVIMA was evaluated in REFLECT, which randomized (1:1) patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to LENVIMA (n=476) or sorafenib (n=475) [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.3 ) ] . The dose of LENVIMA was 12 mg orally once daily for patients with a baseline body weight of \u226560 kg and 8 mg orally once daily for patients with a baseline body weight of <60 kg. The dose of sorafenib was 400 mg orally twice daily. Duration of treatment was \u22656 months in 49% and 32% of patients in the LENVIMA and sorafenib groups, respectively. Among the 476 patients who received LENVIMA in REFLECT, the median age was 63 years, 85% were men, 28% were White and 70% were Asian. The most common adverse reactions observed in the LENVIMA-treated patients (\u226520%) were, in order of decreasing frequency, hypertension, fatigue, diarrhea, decreased appetite, arthralgia/myalgia, decreased weight, abdominal pain, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, proteinuria, dysphonia, hemorrhagic events, hypothyroidism, and nausea. The most common serious adverse reactions (\u22652%) in LENVIMA-treated patients were hepatic encephalopathy (5%), hepatic failure (3%), ascites (3%), and decreased appetite (2%). Adverse reactions led to dose reduction or interruption in 62% of patients receiving LENVIMA. The most common adverse reactions (\u22655%) resulting in dose reduction or interruption of LENVIMA were fatigue (9%), decreased appetite (8%), diarrhea (8%), proteinuria (7%), hypertension (6%), and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (5%). Treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions occurred in 20% of patients in the LENVIMA-treated group. The most common adverse reactions (\u22651%) resulting in discontinuation of LENVIMA were fatigue (1%), hepatic encephalopathy (2%), hyperbilirubinemia (1%), and hepatic failure (1%). Table 9 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred in \u226510% of patients receiving LENVIMA in REFLECT. REFLECT was not designed to demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in adverse reaction rates for LENVIMA, as compared to sorafenib, for any specified adverse reaction listed in Table 9.

LENVIMA (n=278 to 470) and sorafenib (n=260 to 473) Endometrial Carcinoma The safety of LENVIMA in combination with pembrolizumab was investigated in Study 309, a multicenter, open-label, randomized (1:1), active-controlled trial in patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma previously treated with at least one prior platinum-based chemotherapy regimen in any setting, including in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings [see Clinical Studies ( 14.4 ) ]. Patients with endometrial carcinoma that are pMMR or not MSI-H received LENVIMA 20 mg orally once daily with pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks (n=342); or received doxorubicin or paclitaxel (n= 325). For patients with pMMR or not MSI-H status, the median duration of study treatment was 7.2 months (range 1 day to 26.8 months) and the median duration of exposure to LENVIMA was 6.7 months (range: 1 day to 26.8 months). Fatal adverse reactions among these patients occurred in 4.7% of those treated with LENVIMA and pembrolizumab, including 2 cases of pneumonia, and 1 case of the following: acute kidney injury, acute myocardial infarction, colitis, decreased appetite, intestinal perforation, lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage, malignant gastrointestinal obstruction, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, myelodysplastic syndrome, pulmonary embolism, and right ventricular dysfunction. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 50% of these patients receiving LENVIMA and pembrolizumab. Serious adverse reactions with frequency \u22653% were hypertension (4.4%), and urinary tract infection (3.2%). Discontinuation of LENVIMA due to an adverse reaction occurred in 26% of these patients. The most common (\u22651 %) adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of LENVIMA were hypertension (2%), asthenia (1.8%), diarrhea (1.2%), decreased appetite (1.2%), proteinuria (1.2%), and vomiting (1.2%). Dose reductions of LENVIMA due to adverse reactions occurred in 67% of patients. The most common (\u22655%) adverse reactions resulting in dose reduction of LENVIMA were hypertension (18%), diarrhea (11%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (9%), proteinuria (7%), fatigue (7%), decreased appetite (6%), asthenia (5%), and weight decreased (5%). Dose interruptions of LENVIMA due to an adverse reaction occurred in 58% of these patients. The most common (\u22652%) adverse reactions leading to interruption of LENVIMA were hypertension (11%), diarrhea (11%), proteinuria (6%), decreased appetite (5%), vomiting (5%), increased alanine aminotransferase (3.5%), fatigue (3.5%), nausea (3.5%), abdominal pain (2.9%), weight decreased (2.6%), urinary tract infection (2.6%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (2.3%), asthenia (2.3%), and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (2%).
