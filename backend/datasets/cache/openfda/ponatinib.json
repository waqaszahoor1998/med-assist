    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong CYP3A Inhibitors : Avoid coadministration or reduce ICLUSIG dose if coadministration cannot be avoided. ( 2.3 , 7.1 ) Strong CYP3A Inducers : Avoid coadministration. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on ICLUSIG Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Coadministration of ICLUSIG with a strong CYP3A inhibitor increases ponatinib plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] , which may increase the risk of ICLUSIG adverse reactions. Avoid coadministration of ICLUSIG with strong CYP3A inhibitors. If coadministration of ICLUSIG with strong CYP3A inhibitors cannot be avoided, reduce the ICLUSIG dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Strong CYP3A Inducers Coadministration of ICLUSIG with a strong CYP3A inducer decreases ponatinib plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Avoid coadministration of ICLUSIG with strong CYP3A inducers unless the benefit outweighs the risk of decreased ponatinib exposure. Monitor patients for reduced efficacy. Selection of concomitant medication with no or minimal CYP3A induction potential is recommended."

The most common adverse reactions identified in the Highlights of the Prescribing Information are based on two safety populations. The first is from a pooled safety population of 543 patients with CML or resistant or intolerant Ph+ ALL (OPTIC and PACE studies) who received ICLUSIG as a single agent at a starting dose of 45 mg orally once daily. In this pooled safety population, the most common (>20%) adverse reactions were rash and related conditions, arthralgia, abdominal pain, headache, constipation, dry skin, hypertension, fatigue, fluid retention and edema, pyrexia, nausea, pancreatitis/lipase elevation, hemorrhage, anemia, hepatic dysfunction, and AOEs. The most common Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities (>20%) were platelet count decreased, neutrophil cell count decreased, and white blood cell decreased. The second safety population is from163 patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL (PhALLCON study) who received ICLUSIG in combination with chemotherapy at a starting dose of 30 mg orally once daily. The most common adverse reactions (>20%) included hepatic dysfunction, arthralgia, rash and related conditions, headache, pyrexia, abdominal pain, constipation, fatigue, nausea, oral mucositis, hypertension, pancreatitis/lipase elevation, neuropathy peripheral, hemorrhage, febrile neutropenia, fluid retention and edema, vomiting, paresthesia, and cardiac arrhythmias. The most common Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities (>20%) included decreased white blood cell count, decreased neutrophil cell count, decreased platelet count, decreased lymphocyte cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased lipase, and increased ALT. Newly Diagnosed Ph+ ALL The safety of ICLUSIG was evaluated in PhALLCON, a randomized, active-controlled, multicenter trial conducted in patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Patients received ICLUSIG (n=163) or imatinib 600 mg (n=81) in combination with reduced-intensity chemotherapy followed by continued treatment with ICLUSIG or imatinib as a single agent (imatinib in combination with chemotherapy is not an approved regimen in adult patients). In the ICLUSIG arm, patients received a starting dosage of ICLUSIG 30 mg orally once daily in combination with chemotherapy, with a reduction to 15 mg orally once daily upon achievement of MRD-negative CR at the end of induction. The median duration of exposure was 9.0 months (range: <1 month to 4.2 years) in the ICLUSIG arm and 5.2 months (range: <1 month to 4.4 years) in the imatinib arm. Patients with uncontrolled hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, or diabetes and patients with clinically significant, uncontrolled, or active cardiovascular disease, including any history of myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular infarction, revascularization procedure, venous thromboembolism, clinically significant atrial/ventricular tachyarrhythmias, history of myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or congestive heart failure within the 6 months prior to the first dose of ICLUSIG, were excluded. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 63% of patients receiving ICLUSIG in combination with chemotherapy. Serious adverse reactions in >2% of patients included febrile neutropenia (18%), pyrexia (6%), thrombocytopenia (4.3%), sepsis (3.7%), septic shock (3.7%), anemia (2.5%), hemorrhage (2.5%), neutropenia (2.5%), pancreatitis (2.5%), peripheral neuropathy (2.5%), pneumonia (2.5%) and acute kidney injury (2.5%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 6% of patients who received ICLUSIG in combination with chemotherapy, including sepsis (3.7%), sudden death, pneumonitis and respiratory failure (0.6%, each). Permanent discontinuation of ICLUSIG due to adverse reactions occurred in 13% of patients. Adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of ICLUSIG in >2% of patients included arterial occlusive events and sepsis. Dosage modifications (dose interruption or reduction) of ICLUSIG due to adverse reactions occurred in 71% of patients. Adverse reactions leading to dose interruption or reduction of ICLUSIG in >5% of patients included increased ALT, neutropenia, increased lipase, thrombocytopenia, increased AST, febrile neutropenia, and abdominal pain.

Patients received one of three starting doses of ICLUSIG: 45 mg orally once daily (n=94), 30 mg orally once daily (n=94), or 15 mg orally once daily (n=94). Patients with uncontrolled hypertension or diabetes and patients with clinically significant, uncontrolled, or active cardiovascular disease, including any history of myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular infarction, revascularization procedure, congestive heart failure, venous thromboembolism, or clinically significant atrial/ventricular arrhythmias, were excluded. Only the safety information for the recommended starting dosage (45 mg) is described below. Patients who received a starting dose of ICLUSIG 45 mg orally once daily had a mandatory dose reduction to 15 mg once daily upon achievement of \u22641% BCR::ABL IS . Of these patients, 76% were exposed for 1 year or longer and 38% were exposed for greater than two years. The median time to the response-based dose reduction to 15 mg was 6.4 months (range: 3.1 months to 1.8 years). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 34% of patients who received ICLUSIG at a starting dose of 45 mg. Serious adverse reactions in >2% of patients included AOEs (9%; of which 2.1% were sudden death), cardiac arrhythmias (6%), thrombocytopenia (5%), pyrexia (4.3%), anemia (3.2%), abdominal pain (3.2%), atrial fibrillation (2.1%), pancreatitis/lipase elevation (2.1%), neutropenia (2.1%), and hypertension (2.1%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 2 patients (2.1%), both of which were sudden death. Permanent discontinuation of ICLUSIG due to an adverse reaction occurred in 19% of patients who received ICLUSIG at a starting dose of 45 mg. Adverse reactions which resulted in permanent discontinuation in >2% of patients included AOEs, thrombocytopenia, hypertension, and sudden death. Dose modifications (dose interruption or reductions) of ICLUSIG due to an adverse reaction occurred in 71% of patients who received ICLUSIG at a starting dose of 45 mg. Adverse reactions which required dose interruptions or reductions in >5% of patients included thrombocytopenia, pancreatitis/lipase elevation, neutropenia, hepatic dysfunction, rash and related conditions, and anemia. The most common (>20%) adverse reactions were rash and related conditions, hypertension, arthralgia, hyperlipidemia, hepatic dysfunction, pancreatitis/lipase elevation, and abdominal pain. The most common (>20%) Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities were platelet count decreased and neutrophil cell count decreased.

Eligible patients had CML or Ph+ ALL whose disease was considered to be resistant or intolerant to prior kinase inhibitor, including those with the BCR::ABL T315I mutation. Patients with uncontrolled hypertriglyceridemia and patients with clinically significant or active cardiovascular disease, including any history of clinically significant atrial/ventricular arrhythmias or history of myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or congestive heart failure within the 3 months prior to the first dose of ICLUSIG, were excluded. Patients received a starting dose of ICLUSIG 45 mg orally once daily (N=449). Dose reductions to 30 mg orally once daily or 15 mg orally once daily were allowed for the management of adverse reactions. After approximately 2 years of follow-up, patients who were still taking a 45 mg orally once daily dose were recommended to undergo a dose reduction in response to the continued occurrence of AOEs and VTEs in the clinical trial [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . At study completion (60 months of follow-up), the median duration of treatment with ICLUSIG was 32 months in patients with CP-CML, 19 months in patients with AP-CML, 2.9 months in patients with BP-CML, and 2.7 months in patients with Ph+ ALL. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 69% of patients who received ICLUSIG. Serious adverse reactions in >2% of patients included AOEs (20%), pneumonia (10%), cardiac arrhythmias (8%), pancreatitis/lipase elevation (7%), abdominal pain (6%), cardiac failure (6%), hemorrhage (6%), sepsis (5%), VTEs (5%), fluid retention and edema (4.5%), pyrexia (4.5%), secondary malignancies (5%), anemia (3.3%), hypertension (3.1%), thrombocytopenia (3.1%), febrile neutropenia (2.9%), cellulitis (2.7%), and arthralgia (2.2%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 9% of patients who received ICLUSIG; the most frequent fatal adverse reactions were AOEs (2%), sepsis (1.6%), and hemorrhage (1.3%). Permanent discontinuation of ICLUSIG due to an adverse reaction occurred in 21% of CP-CML, 12% of AP-CML, 15% of BP-CML, and 9% of Ph+ ALL patients. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to treatment discontinuation were thrombocytopenia (4.5%) and AOEs (4%). Dose interruption of ICLUSIG for more than 3 days due to an adverse reaction occurred in 71% of patients and dose reduction of ICLUSIG due to an adverse reaction occurred in 68% of patients. Adverse reactions which required a dosage interruption or dose reduction in >5% of patients included thrombocytopenia (31%), pancreatitis/lipase elevation (17%), abdominal pain (14%), rash and related conditions (14%), neutropenia (14%), hepatic dysfunction (12%), AOEs (10%), arthralgia (8%), anemia (7%), ALT increased (6%), and AST increased (5%). The most common (>20%) non-hematologic adverse reactions were rash and related conditions, arthralgia, abdominal pain, fatigue, constipation, headache, dry skin, fluid retention and edema, hepatic dysfunction, hypertension, pyrexia, nausea, hemorrhage, pancreatitis/lipase elevation, AOEs, diarrhea, vomiting, and myalgia.

Heart Failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Grade 2 or 3 Interrupt ICLUSIG until Grade 0 or 1, then resume at next lower dose. Discontinue ICLUSIG if recurrence. Grade 4 Discontinue ICLUSIG. Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] AST or ALT greater than 3 times ULN Interrupt ICLUSIG until Grade 0 or 1, then resume at next lower dose. AST or ALT at least 3 times ULN concurrent with bilirubin greater than 2 times ULN and alkaline phosphatase less than 2 times ULN Discontinue ICLUSIG. Pancreatitis and Elevated Lipase [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Serum lipase greater than 1 to 1.5 times ULN Consider interrupting ICLUSIG until resolution, then resume at same dose. Serum lipase greater than 1.5 to 2 times ULN, 2 to 5 times ULN and asymptomatic, or asymptomatic radiologic pancreatitis Interrupt ICLUSIG until Grade 0 or 1 (less than 1.5 times ULN), then resume at next lower dose. Serum lipase greater than 2 to 5 times ULN and symptomatic, symptomatic Grade 3 pancreatitis, or serum lipase greater than 5 times ULN and asymptomatic Interrupt ICLUSIG until complete resolution of symptoms and after recovery of lipase elevation Grade 0 or 1, then resume at next lower dose. Symptomatic pancreatitis and serum lipase greater than 5 times ULN Discontinue ICLUSIG. Myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) ] ANC less than 1 \u00d7 10 9 /L or Platelets less than 50 \u00d7 10 9 /L Interrupt ICLUSIG until ANC at least 1.5 \u00d7 10 9 /L and platelet at least 75 \u00d7 10 9 /L, then resume at same dose. If recurrence, interrupt ICLUSIG until resolution, then resume at next lower dose. Other Non-hematologic Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5 , 5.8 , 5.10 , 5.11 , 5.12) ] Grade 1 Interrupt ICLUSIG until resolved, then resume at same dose.

Table 2: Recommended Dose Reductions for ICLUSIG for Adverse Reactions Dose Reduction Dosage for Patients with CP-CML Dosage for Patients with AP-CML, BP-CML, and Ph+ ALL Monotherapy Dosage for Patients with Newly Diagnosed Ph+ ALL First 30 mg orally once daily 30 mg orally once daily 15 mg orally once daily Second 15 mg orally once daily 15 mg orally once daily 10 mg orally once daily Third 10 mg orally once daily Permanently discontinue ICLUSIG in patients unable to tolerate 15 mg orally once daily. Permanently discontinue ICLUSIG in patients unable to tolerate 10 mg orally once daily. Subsequent Reduction Permanently discontinue ICLUSIG in patients unable to tolerate 10 mg orally once daily. 2.3 Dosage Modification for Coadministration of Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Avoid coadministration of ICLUSIG with strong CYP3A inhibitors. If coadministration of a strong CYP3A inhibitor cannot be avoided, reduce the dosage of ICLUSIG as recommended in Table 3. After the strong CYP3A inhibitor has been discontinued for 3 to 5 elimination half-lives, resume the ICLUSIG dosage that was tolerated prior to initiating the strong CYP3A inhibitor [see Drug Interactions (7.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Table 3: Recommended ICLUSIG Dosage for Coadministration of Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Current ICLUSIG Dosage Recommended ICLUSIG Dosage with a Strong CYP3A Inhibitor 45 mg orally once daily 30 mg orally once daily 30 mg orally once daily 15 mg orally once daily 15 mg orally once daily 10 mg orally once daily 10 mg orally once daily Avoid coadministration of ICLUSIG with a strong CYP3A inhibitor 2.4 Dosage for Patients with Hepatic Impairment For patients with CP-CML, AP-CML, BP-CML, and Ph+ ALL receiving monotherapy, reduce the starting dose of ICLUSIG from 45 mg orally once daily to 30 mg orally once daily in patients with pre-existing hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A, B, or C). For patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL, no dosage adjustment is recommended when administering ICLUSIG to patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A). Closely monitor patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C) and modify the ICLUSIG dosage in the event of adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] ."
