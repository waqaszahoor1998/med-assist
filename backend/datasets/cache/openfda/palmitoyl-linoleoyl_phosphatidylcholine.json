Hormone Receptor-Positive, HER2-Negative Breast Cancer The safety of everolimus tablets (10 mg orally once daily) in combination with exemestane (25 mg orally once daily) (n = 485) vs. placebo in combination with exemestane (n = 239) was evaluated in a randomized, controlled trial (BOLERO-2) in patients with advanced or metastatic hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer. The median age of patients was 61 years (28 to 93 years), and 75% were White. The median follow-up was approximately 13 months. The most common adverse reactions (incidence \u2265 30%) were stomatitis, infections, rash, fatigue, diarrhea, and decreased appetite. The most common Grade 3-4 adverse reactions (incidence \u2265 2%) were stomatitis, infections, hyperglycemia, fatigue, dyspnea, pneumonitis, and diarrhea. The most common laboratory abnormalities (incidence \u2265 50%) were hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia, increased aspartate transaminase (AST), anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, increased alanine transaminase (ALT), and hypertriglyceridemia. The most common Grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities (incidence \u2265 3%) were lymphopenia, hyperglycemia, anemia, hypokalemia, increased AST, increased ALT, and thrombocytopenia. Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 2% of patients who received everolimus tablets. The rate of adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation was 24% for the everolimus tablets arm. Dose adjustments (interruptions or reductions) occurred in 63% of patients in the everolimus tablets arm. Adverse reactions reported with an incidence of \u2265 10% for patients receiving everolimus tablets vs. placebo are presented in Table 6. Laboratory abnormalities are presented in Table 7. The median duration of treatment with everolimus tablets was 23.9 weeks; 33% were exposed to everolimus tablets for a period of \u2265 32 weeks.

No food or drink was to be consumed for at least 1 hour after swishing and spitting the dexamethasone mouthwash. The primary objective of this study was to assess the incidence of Grade 2 to 4 stomatitis within 8 weeks. The incidence of Grade 2 to 4 stomatitis within 8 weeks was 2%, which was lower than the 33% reported in the BOLERO-2 trial. The incidence of Grade 1 stomatitis was 19%. No cases of Grade 3 or 4 stomatitis were reported. Oral candidiasis was reported in 2% of patients in this study compared to 0.2% in the BOLERO-2 trial. Coadministration of everolimus tablets/everolimus tablets for oral suspension and dexamethasone alcohol-free oral solution has not been studied in pediatric patients. Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors (PNET) In a randomized, controlled trial (RADIANT-3) of everolimus tablets (n = 204) vs. placebo (n = 203) in patients with advanced PNET the median age of patients was 58 years (20 to 87 years), 79% were White, and 55% were male. Patients on the placebo arm could cross over to open-label everolimus tablets upon disease progression. The most common adverse reactions (incidence \u2265 30%) were stomatitis, rash, diarrhea, fatigue, edema, abdominal pain, nausea, fever, and headache. The most common Grade 3-4 adverse reactions (incidence \u2265 5%) were stomatitis and diarrhea. The most common laboratory abnormalities (incidence \u2265 50%) were anemia, hyperglycemia, increased alkaline phosphatase, hypercholesterolemia, decreased bicarbonate, and increased AST. The most common Grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities (incidence \u2265 3%) were hyperglycemia, lymphopenia, anemia, hypophosphatemia, increased alkaline phosphatase, neutropenia, increased AST, hypokalemia, and thrombocytopenia. Deaths during double-blind treatment where an adverse reaction was the primary cause occurred in seven patients on everolimus tablets. Causes of death on the everolimus tablets arm included one case of each of the following: acute renal failure, acute respiratory distress, cardiac arrest, death (cause unknown), hepatic failure, pneumonia, and sepsis. After cross-over to open-label everolimus tablets, there were three additional deaths, one due to hypoglycemia and cardiac arrest in a patient with insulinoma, one due to myocardial infarction with congestive heart failure, and the other due to sudden death. The rate of adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation was 20% for the everolimus tablets group. Dose delay or reduction was necessary in 61% of everolimus tablets patients. Grade 3-4 renal failure occurred in six patients in the everolimus tablets arm. Thrombotic events included five patients with pulmonary embolus in the everolimus tablets arm as well as three patients with thrombosis in the everolimus tablets arm. Table 8 compares the incidence of adverse reactions reported with an incidence of \u2265 10% for patients receiving everolimus tablets vs. placebo. Laboratory abnormalities are summarized in Table 9. The median duration of treatment in patients who received everolimus tablets was 37 weeks. In female patients aged 18 to 55 years, irregular menstruation occurred in 5 of 46 (11%) everolimus tablets-treated females.
