    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Certain CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 Substrates: Monitor for adverse reactions of these substrates where minimal concentration changes may lead to serious or life-threatening toxicities. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Effect of GRAFAPEX on Other Drugs Certain CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 Substrates Monitor for adverse reactions of certain CYP2C19 or CYP3A4 substrates where minimal concentration changes may lead to serious or life-threatening toxicities, and reduce the dosage, as needed, if recommended in the prescribing information of these substrates. Treosulfan is a CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 inhibitor [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 )] . Concomitant use of GRAFAPEX is predicted to increase the exposure of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 substrates based on a mechanistic understanding of treosulfan metabolism, which may increase the risk of their adverse reactions."

    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Skin Disorders [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Injection Site Reactions and Tissue Necrosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Secondary Malignancies [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] The most common adverse reactions (\u226520%) are musculoskeletal pain, stomatitis, pyrexia, nausea, edema, infection, and vomiting. ( 6.1 ) Selected Grade 3 or 4 nonhematological laboratory abnormalities are increased GGT, increased bilirubin, increased ALT, increased AST, and increased creatinine. To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Medexus Pharma, Inc. at 1-855-336 -3322 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. MC\u2011FludT.14/L Trial II The safety of GRAFAPEX was evaluated in 553 adult patients with AML and MDS in a randomized trial (MC\u2011FludT.14/L Trial II) comparing GRAFAPEX in combination with fludarabine to busulfan in combination with fludarabine as a preparative regimen for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The patients were randomized to receive GRAFAPEX (n=270) 10 g/m\u00b2 daily on day -4, -3 and -2 or to busulfan (n=283) 0.8 mg/kg every 6 hours on day -4 and -3 in combination with fludarabine 30 mg/m 2 daily on day -6, -5, -4, -3 and -2, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation on day 0 [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . Fatal regimen-related adverse reactions occurred within 30 days of transplantation in 1.9% of patients on the GRAFAPEX arm. All fatalities were due to pulmonary adverse reactions. The most common adverse reactions (\u226520%) in patients treated with GRAFAPEX were musculoskeletal pain, stomatitis, pyrexia, nausea, edema, infection, and vomiting. Selected Grade 3 or 4 nonhematological laboratory abnormalities were increased GGT, increased bilirubin, increased ALT, increased AST, and increased creatinine. Table 3 shows the adverse reactions in Study MC\u2011FludT.14/L Trial II through transplant Day +30.

One patient on the GRAFAPEX arm had graft failure.

As these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

    "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended dosage: 10 g/m\u00b2 body surface area (BSA) per day as a two hour intravenous infusion, given on three consecutive days (day -4, -3, -2) in conjunction with fludarabine before hematopoietic stem cell infusion (day 0). ( 2.1 , 2.2 ) See Full Prescribing Information for instructions on preparation and administration. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosage The recommended dosage of GRAFAPEX is 10 g/m 2 by intravenous infusion given daily for three days, beginning on Day -4 prior to transplantation in combination with fludarabine as outlined in Table 1. Table 1: Dosage Regimen for GRAFAPEX-Based Allogeneic HSCT Treatment Day -6 Day -5 Day -4 Day-3 Day -2 Day -1 Day 0 GRAFAPEX 10 g/m 2 /day intravenous infusion X X X Fludarabine 30 mg/m 2 /day intravenous infusion X X X X X Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell infusion X Premedicate patients with antiemetics prior to the first dose of GRAFAPEX and continue antiemetics on a fixed schedule through completion of treosulfan administration. 2.2 Preparation and Administration Instructions Reconstitute GRAFAPEX prior to intravenous infusion. GRAFAPEX is a hazardous drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures. 1 Use aseptic technique to prepare GRAFAPEX. Calculate the dose, the total volume of reconstituted GRAFAPEX solution required, and the number of GRAFAPEX vials needed. Reconstitute each vial with 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, 5% Dextrose Injection, or Sterile Water for Injection, in its original glass container using volumes described in Table 2 to obtain a final concentration of approximately 0.05 g/mL of GRAFAPEX. Reconstitution with Sterile Water for Injection alone is not recommended in children less than or equal to 12 years of age due to the resulting hypo-osmolarity of the final solution. Table 2: Reconstitution Solution Volume Strength Volume 1 g/vial 20 mL 5 g/vial 100 mL Shake the vial(s) to dissolve. Inspect the reconstituted solution for discoloration and particulate matter. The reconstituted solution appears as a clear colorless solution. Solutions showing any sign of precipitation should not be used. In case that solubility issues occur, prolonged standing time or slight warming of the reconstituted solution (hand warm) may be useful. Determine the volume of 0.05 g/mL reconstituted solution needed based on the required dose. Reconstituted solutions of GRAFAPEX may be combined into a larger glass vial, ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) bag or polyolefin (PO) bag. Discard any unused portion left in the vial(s). If not used immediately store reconstituted GRAFAPEX solution at room temperature 20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C (68\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F) for up to 24 hours. Do not use if the solution contains a precipitate. Do not refrigerate. Infuse GRAFAPEX intravenously over 2 hours. Confirm patency of the intravenous line prior to infusion. Monitor for extravasation; if extravasation occurs, stop the infusion [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] ."
