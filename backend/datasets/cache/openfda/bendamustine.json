    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the prescribing information. Myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Infections [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Anaphylaxis and Infusion Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Tumor Lysis Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Skin Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] Other Malignancies [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Extravasation Injury [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 ) ] Adverse reactions (frequency >5%) during infusion and within 24 hours post-infusion are nausea and fatigue. ( 6.1 ) Most common adverse reactions (\u226515%) for NHL are lymphopenia, leukopenia, anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, nausea, fatigue, vomiting, diarrhea, pyrexia, constipation, anorexia, cough, headache, weight decreased, dyspnea, rash, and stomatitis.( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Apotex Corp. at 1-800-706-5575 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Clinical Trials Experience in NHL The data described below reflect exposure to bendamustine hydrochloride in 176 patients with indolent B-cell NHL treated in two single-arm studies. The population was 31 to 84 years of age, 60% male, and 40% female. The race distribution was 89% White, 7% Black, 3% Hispanic, 1% other, and <1% Asian. These patients received bendamustine hydrochloride at a dose of 120 mg/m 2 intravenously on Days 1 and 2 for up to eight 21-day cycles. The adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of the NHL patients, regardless of severity, are shown in Table 3. The most common non-hematologic adverse reactions (\u226530%) were nausea (75%), fatigue (57%), vomiting (40%), diarrhea (37%) and pyrexia (34%). The most common non-hematologic Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions (\u22655%) were fatigue (11%), febrile neutropenia (6%), and pneumonia, hypokalemia and dehydration, each reported in 5% of patients.

NOTE: Patients counted only once in each preferred term category and once in each system organ class category. Hematologic toxicities, based on laboratory values and CTC grade, in NHL patients treated in both single arm studies combined are described in Table 4. Clinically important chemistry laboratory values that were new or worsened from baseline and occurred in >1% of patients at Grade 3 or 4, in NHL patients treated in both single arm studies combined were hyperglycemia (3%), elevated creatinine (2%), hyponatremia (2%), and hypocalcemia (2%).

The most common serious adverse reactions occurring in \u22655% of patients were febrile neutropenia and pneumonia. Other important serious adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and/or post-marketing experience were acute renal failure, cardiac failure, hypersensitivity, skin reactions, pulmonary fibrosis, and myelodysplastic syndrome. Serious drug-related adverse reactions reported in clinical trials included myelosuppression, infection, pneumonia, tumor lysis syndrome and infusion reactions. Adverse reactions occurring less frequently but possibly related to bendamustine hydrochloride treatment were hemolysis, dysgeusia/taste disorder, atypical pneumonia, sepsis, herpes zoster, erythema, dermatitis, and skin necrosis. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of bendamustine hydrochloride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and lymphatic systems disorders : Pancytopenia Cardiovascular disorders : Atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure (some fatal), myocardial infarction (some fatal), palpitation General disorders and administration site conditions : Injection site reactions (including phlebitis, pruritus, irritation, pain, swelling), infusion site reactions (including phlebitis, pruritus, irritation, pain, swelling) Immune system disorders : Anaphylaxis Infections and infestations : Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) Renal and urinary disorders: Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders : Pneumonitis Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)."

Dose Delays, Dosage Modifications and Reinitiation of Therapy for NHL: Delay bendamustine hydrochloride injection administration in the event of a Grade 4 hematologic toxicity or clinically significant greater or equal to Grade 2 non-hematologic toxicity. Once non-hematologic toxicity has recovered to \u2264 Grade 1 and/or the blood counts have improved [Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) \u2265 1 x 10 9 /L, platelets \u2265 75 x 10 9 /L], reinitiate bendamustine hydrochloride injection at the discretion of the treating physician. In addition, consider dose reduction. [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Dosage modifications for hematologic toxicity: for Grade 4 toxicity, reduce the dose to 90 mg/m 2 on Days 1 and 2 of each cycle; if Grade 4 toxicity recurs, reduce the dose to 60 mg/m 2 on Days 1 and 2 of each cycle. Dosage modifications for non-hematologic toxicity: for Grade 3 or greater toxicity, reduce the dose to 90 mg/m 2 on Days 1 and 2 of each cycle; if Grade 3 or greater toxicity recurs, reduce the dose to 60 mg/m 2 on Days 1 and 2 of each cycle. 2.2 Preparation for Intravenous Administration Bendamustine hydrochloride injection is a hazardous drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures. 1 Bendamustine hydrochloride injection is in a multiple-dose vial. Bendamustine hydrochloride injection is a clear and colorless to yellow solution. Store bendamustine hydrochloride injection at recommended refrigerated storage conditions (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C or 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F). When refrigerated the contents may freeze. Allow the vial to reach room temperature (15\u00b0C to 30\u00b0C or 59\u00b0F to 86\u00b0F) prior to use. Observe the contents of the vial for any visible solid or particulate matter and discoloration. Do not use the product if solid or particulate matter is observed after reaching room temperature. Intravenous Infusion Aseptically withdraw the volume needed for the required dose from the 25 mg/mL solution as per Table A below and immediately transfer to a 500 mL infusion bag of one of the following diluents: - 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP; or - 2.5% Dextrose/0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. The resulting final concentration of bendamustine hydrochloride injection in the infusion bag should be within 0.05 mg/mL to 0.7 mg/mL. After transferring, thoroughly mix the contents of the infusion bag. The admixture should be a clear and colorless to slightly yellow solution. Use either 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, or 2.5% Dextrose/0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, for dilution, as outlined above. No other diluents have been shown to be compatible.
