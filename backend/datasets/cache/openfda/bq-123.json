    "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The recommended oral dose for the average patient (70 kg) is 3.7 to 14.8 MBq (100 to 400 \u03bcCi). The lower part of the dosage range 3.7 MBq (100 \u03bcCi) is recommended for uptake studies alone, and the higher part 14.8 MBq (400 \u03bcCi) for thyroid imaging. The determination of I-123 concentration in the thyroid gland may be initiated at six hours after administering the dose and should be measured in accordance with standardized procedures. The patient dose should be measured by a suitable radioactivity calibration system immediately prior to administration. The capsules can be utilized up to 30 hours after calibration time and date. Thereafter, discard the capsules in accordance with standard safety procedures. The user should wear waterproof gloves at all times when handling the capsules or container. Radiation Dosimetry The estimated absorbed radiation doses to several organs of an average patient (70 kg) from oral administration of the maximum dose of 14.8 MBq (400 \u03bcCi) of I-123 are shown in Table 4 for thyroid uptakes of 5, 15, and 25%. For comparison at these three values of thyroid uptake, the estimated radiation doses from doses of 3.7 MBq (100 \u03bcCi) I-131, also used as thyroid imaging agent, are also included. Table 4.
