    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022 Strong CYP2C8 Inhibitors: Avoid strong CYP2C8 inhibitors. If coadministration cannot be avoided, reduce the dosage of XTANDI. ( 2.3 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Strong CYP3A4 Inducers: Avoid strong CYP3A4 inducers. If coadministration cannot be avoided, increase the dosage of XTANDI. ( 2.3 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Avoid coadministration with certain CYP3A4, CYP2C9, or CYP2C19 substrates for which a minimal decrease in concentration may lead to therapeutic failure of the substrate. In cases where active metabolites are formed, there may be increased exposure to the active metabolites. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on XTANDI Strong CYP2C8 Inhibitors The coadministration of XTANDI with gemfibrozil (a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor) increases plasma concentrations of enzalutamide plus N-desmethyl enzalutamide, which may increase the incidence and severity of adverse reactions of XTANDI. Avoid the coadministration of XTANDI with strong CYP2C8 inhibitors. If the coadministration of XTANDI with a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor cannot be avoided, reduce the dosage of XTANDI [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Strong CYP3A4 Inducers The coadministration of XTANDI with rifampin (a strong CYP3A4 inducer and a moderate CYP2C8 inducer) decreases plasma concentrations of enzalutamide plus N-desmethyl enzalutamide, which may decrease the efficacy of XTANDI. Avoid the coadministration of XTANDI with strong CYP3A4 inducers. If the coadministration of XTANDI with a strong CYP3A4 inducer cannot be avoided, increase the dosage of XTANDI [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.2 Effect of XTANDI on Other Drugs Certain CYP3A4, CYP2C9, or CYP2C19 Substrates XTANDI is a strong CYP3A4 inducer and a moderate CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 inducer. The coadministration of XTANDI decreases the concentrations of certain CYP3A4, CYP2C9, or CYP2C19 substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , which may reduce the efficacy of these substrates. Avoid the coadministration of XTANDI with certain CYP3A4, CYP2C9, or CYP2C19 substrates for which a minimal decrease in concentration may lead to therapeutic failure of the substrate. If the coadministration cannot be avoided, increase the dosage of these substrates in accordance with their Prescribing Information. In cases where active metabolites are formed, there may be increased exposure to the active metabolites."

    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following is discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling: \u2022 Seizure [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] \u2022 Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] \u2022 Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] \u2022 Ischemic Heart Disease [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] \u2022 Falls and Fractures [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] \u2022 Dysphagia or Choking [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] The most common adverse reactions (\u2265 10%) that occurred more frequently (\u2265 2% over placebo) in the XTANDI-treated patients are musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, hot flush, constipation, decreased appetite, diarrhea, hypertension, hemorrhage, fall, fracture, and headache. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Astellas Pharma US, Inc. at 1-800-727-7003 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data in WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS reflect eight randomized, controlled trials [AFFIRM, PREVAIL, TERRAIN, PROSPER, ARCHES, EMBARK, Asian PREVAIL (NCT02294461), and STRIVE (NCT01664923)] that were pooled to conduct safety analyses in patients with CRPC (N = 3651), mCSPC (N = 752), or nmCSPC with high\u2011risk BCR (N = 707) treated with XTANDI. Patients received XTANDI 160 mg (N = 5110) or placebo orally once daily (N = 2829) or bicalutamide 50 mg orally once daily (N = 387). In these eight trials, the median duration of treatment was 22.1 months (range: < 0.1 to 95.0) in patients that received XTANDI. In five placebo-controlled trials (AFFIRM, PROSPER, PREVAIL, ARCHES, and EMBARK), the median duration of treatment was 19.4 months (range: < 0.1 to 90.4) in the XTANDI group [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. In these five trials, the most common adverse reactions (\u2265 10%) that occurred more frequently (\u2265 2% over placebo) in the XTANDI-treated patients were musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, hot flush, constipation, decreased appetite, diarrhea, hypertension, hemorrhage, fall, fracture and headache. AFFIRM: XTANDI versus Placebo in Metastatic CRPC Following Chemotherapy AFFIRM enrolled 1199 patients with metastatic CRPC who had previously received docetaxel. The median duration of treatment was 8.3 months with XTANDI and 3.0 months with placebo. During the trial, 48% of patients on the XTANDI arm and 46% of patients on the placebo arm received glucocorticoids. Grade 3 and higher adverse reactions were reported among 47% of XTANDI-treated patients. Discontinuations due to adverse reactions were reported for 16% of XTANDI-treated patients. The most common adverse reaction leading to treatment discontinuation was seizure, which occurred in 0.9% of the XTANDI-treated patients compared to none (0%) of the placebo-treated patients. Table 1 shows adverse reactions reported in AFFIRM that occurred at a \u2265 2% higher frequency in the XTANDI arm compared to the placebo arm. Table 1.

Patients were randomized 2:1 and received either XTANDI at a dose of 160 mg once daily (N = 930) or placebo (N = 465). The median duration of treatment at the time of analysis was 18.4 months (range: 0.0 to 42 months) with XTANDI and 11.1 months (range: 0.0 to 43 months) with placebo. Overall, 32 patients (3.4%) receiving XTANDI died from adverse reactions. The reasons for death with \u2265 2 patients included coronary artery disorders (n = 7), sudden death (n = 2), cardiac arrhythmias (n = 2), general physical health deterioration (n = 2), stroke (n = 2), and secondary malignancy (n = 5; one each of acute myeloid leukemia, brain neoplasm, mesothelioma, small cell lung cancer, and malignant neoplasm of unknown primary site). Three patients (0.6%) receiving placebo died from adverse reactions of cardiac arrest (n = 1), left ventricular failure (n = 1), and pancreatic carcinoma (n = 1). Grade 3 or higher adverse reactions were reported among 31% of XTANDI-treated patients and 23% of placebo\u2011treated patients. Discontinuations with an adverse reaction as the primary reason were reported for 9% of XTANDI-treated patients and 6% of placebo-treated patients. Of these, the most common adverse reaction leading to treatment discontinuation was fatigue, which occurred in 1.6% of the XTANDI-treated patients compared to none of the placebo-treated patients. Table 4 shows adverse reactions reported in PROSPER that occurred at a \u2265 2% higher frequency in the XTANDI arm than in the placebo arm. Table 4.

All patients received either a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog concurrently or had bilateral orchiectomy. Patients received either XTANDI at a dose of 160 mg once daily (N = 572) or placebo (N = 574). The median duration of treatment was 12.8 months (range: 0.2 to 26.6 months) with XTANDI and 11.6 months (range: 0.2 to 24.6 months) with placebo. Overall, 10 patients (1.7%) receiving XTANDI died from adverse reactions. The reasons for death in \u2265 2 patients included heart disease (n = 3), sepsis (n = 2) and pulmonary embolism (n = 2). Eight patients (1.4%) receiving placebo died from adverse reactions. The reasons for death in \u2265 2 patients included heart disease (n = 2) and sudden death (n = 2). Grade 3 or higher adverse reactions were reported in 24% of patients treated with XTANDI. Permanent discontinuation due to adverse reactions as the primary reason was reported in 4.9% of XTANDI-treated patients and 3.7% of placebo-treated patients. The most common adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation in XTANDI-treated patients were alanine aminotransferase increased, aspartate aminotransferase elevation, and seizure, each in 0.3%. The most common adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation in placebo-treated patients were arthralgia, and fatigue, each in 0.3%. Dose reductions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 4.4% of patients who received XTANDI. Fatigue/asthenia was the most frequent adverse reaction requiring dose reduction in 2.1% of XTANDI-treated patients and 0.7% of placebo-treated patients. Table 5 shows adverse reactions reported in ARCHES that occurred at a \u2265 2% higher frequency in the XTANDI arm than in the placebo arm. Table 5.

Patients received XTANDI at a dose of 160 mg once daily concurrently with leuprolide (N = 353), XTANDI at a dose of 160 mg once daily as open\u2011label monotherapy (N = 354), or placebo concurrently with leuprolide (N = 354). At week 37, treatment was suspended for patients whose PSA values were undetectable (<0.2 ng/mL) at week 36. Treatment was reinitiated when PSA values increased to \u22652.0 ng/mL for patients with prior prostatectomy or \u22655.0 ng/mL for patients without prior prostatectomy. For patients whose PSA values were detectable (\u22650.2 ng/mL) at week 36, treatment continued without suspension until permanent treatment discontinuation criteria were met. Table 6 shows the total duration of treatment for the three treatment arms. Table 6.

The reason for death in \u2265 2 patients receiving XTANDI plus leuprolide was infection (n = 2), and the reason for death in \u2265 2 patients receiving XTANDI as a single agent was arterial thromboembolism (n=2). Grade 3 or higher adverse reactions during the total duration of treatment were reported in 46% of patients treated with XTANDI plus leuprolide, 50% of patients receiving XTANDI as a single agent, and 43% of patients receiving placebo plus leuprolide. Permanent treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions during the total duration of treatment as the primary reason was reported in 21% of patients treated with XTANDI plus leuprolide, 18% of patients receiving XTANDI as a single agent, and 10% of patients receiving placebo plus leuprolide. The most common adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation included fatigue (3.4% of patients treated with XTANDI plus leuprolide, 3.7% of patients receiving XTANDI as a single agent, and 1.4% of patients receiving placebo plus leuprolide), hot flush (2% of patients treated with XTANDI plus leuprolide, 0% of patients receiving XTANDI as a single agent, and 1.1% of patients receiving placebo plus leuprolide), nausea (1.1% of patients treated with XTANDI plus leuprolide, 0.6% of patients receiving XTANDI as a single agent, and 0.3% of patients receiving placebo plus leuprolide), and cognitive disorder (1.1% of patients treated with XTANDI plus leuprolide, 1.4% of patients receiving XTANDI as a single agent, and 0.8% of patients receiving placebo plus leuprolide). Dose reductions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 7% of patients who received XTANDI plus leuprolide, 16% of patients who received XTANDI as a single agent, and 4.5% of patients who received placebo plus leuprolide. Fatigue was the most frequent adverse reaction requiring dose reduction in 3.1% of patients treated with XTANDI plus leuprolide, 10% of patients receiving XTANDI as a single agent, and 1.7% of patients receiving placebo plus leuprolide. Table 7 shows adverse reactions reported in EMBARK that occurred at a \u2265 5% (Grade 1-4) or \u2265 2% (Grade 3-4) higher frequency in either of the XTANDI arms than in the placebo arm. Table 7.

Hypertension led to study discontinuation in < 1% of patients in each arm. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of XTANDI. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal Disorders: vomiting, dysphagia (including choking related to XTANDI product size) Immune System Disorders: hypersensitivity (edema of the face, tongue, lip, or pharynx) Neurological Disorders: posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), dysgeusia Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: rash, severe cutaneous adverse reactions (including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), erythema multiforme, toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP))"

    "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Take XTANDI 160 mg administered orally once daily with or without food. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Advise patients to take each capsule or tablet whole with a sufficient amount of water to ensure that all medication is successfully swallowed. ( 2.1 , 5.7 ) \u2022 Patients receiving XTANDI for castration-resistant prostate cancer, or metastatic castration sensitive prostate cancer should also receive a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog concurrently or should have had bilateral orchiectomy. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Patients with non-metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer with biochemical recurrence at high risk for metastasis may be treated with or without a GnRH analog. ( 2.1 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosage The recommended dosage of XTANDI is 160 mg administered orally once daily with or without food [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Advise patients to take each capsule or tablet whole with a sufficient amount of water to ensure that all medication is successfully swallowed. Do NOT chew, dissolve, or open the capsules. Do NOT cut, crush, or chew the tablets. Patients with CRPC or mCSPC receiving XTANDI should also receive a gonadotropic-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog concurrently or should have had bilateral orchiectomy. Patients with nmCSPC with high-risk BCR may be treated with XTANDI with or without a GnRH analog. For patients who receive XTANDI with or without a GnRH analog, treatment can be suspended if PSA is undetectable (< 0.2 ng/mL) after 36 weeks of therapy. Reinitiate treatment when PSA has increased to \u2265 2.0 ng/mL for patients who had prior radical prostatectomy or \u2265 5.0 ng/mL for patients who had prior primary radiation therapy [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . 2.2 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions If a patient experiences a \u2265 Grade 3 or an intolerable adverse reaction, withhold XTANDI for one week or until symptoms improve to \u2264 Grade 2, then resume at the same or a reduced dose (120 mg or 80 mg) if warranted [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 , 5.2 )] . 2.3 Dosage Modifications for Drug Interactions Strong CYP2C8 Inhibitors Avoid the coadministration of strong CYP2C8 inhibitors. If the coadministration of a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor cannot be avoided, reduce the XTANDI dosage to 80 mg once daily. If the coadministration of the strong inhibitor is discontinued, increase the XTANDI dosage to the dosage used prior to initiation of the strong CYP2C8 inhibitor [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Avoid the coadministration of strong CYP3A4 inducers. If the coadministration of a strong CYP3A4 inducer cannot be avoided, increase the XTANDI dosage from 160 mg to 240 mg orally once daily. If the coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued, decrease the XTANDI dosage to the dosage used prior to initiation of the strong CYP3A4 inducer [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."
