    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide 1B1/1B3 (OATP1B1/OATP1B3) Substrates: ZEVTERA may increase the plasma concentrations of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 substrates. Concomitant administration is not recommended ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide 1B1/1B3 (OATP1B1/OATP1B3) Substrates ZEVTERA may increase the plasma concentrations of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 substrates. Concomitant administration is not recommended [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.2 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions Dipstick Tests ZEVTERA may result in false-positive results in dipstick tests (urine protein, ketones, or occult blood). Use alternate clinical laboratory methods of testing to confirm positive tests. Serological Testing Treatment with ZEVTERA has the potential to interfere with serological testing, such as the Coombs test. In clinical studies there was no evidence of hemolytic anemia in adults or children. However, the possibility that hemolytic anemia may occur cannot be ruled out. Patients experiencing anemia during or after treatment should be investigated for this possibility."

Overview of the Safety Evaluation of ZEVTERA ZEVTERA was evaluated in four controlled comparative phase 3 clinical trials (TRIALS 1 through 4) which included 1221 adult patients treated with ZEVTERA 667 mg (equivalent to 500 mg of ceftobiprole) administered by IV infusion over 2 hours every 6 to 8 hours and 1248 patients treated with comparator for a treatment period up to 42 days. The median age of patients treated with ZEVTERA was 56 years, ranging between 18 and 95 years old. Patients treated with ZEVTERA were predominantly male (64%) and White (82%). ZEVTERA was also evaluated in a controlled phase 3 clinical trial (TRIAL 5) which included 138 pediatric patients aged from 3 months to less than 18 years with CABP and hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia (HABP) requiring hospitalization. Although HABP was included in the safety data, the safety and effectiveness of ZEVTERA for the treatment of HABP has not been established and ZEVTERA is not approved for the treatment of HABP. Adult Patients Clinical Trials Experience in Adult Patients with Staphylococcus aureus Bloodstream Infection (Bacteremia) ZEVTERA was evaluated in an active-controlled randomized, double-blind, multicenter phase 3 trial (TRIAL 1) in patients with Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infection (bacteremia) (SAB) including right-sided infective endocarditis. In TRIAL 1, 191 patients received ZEVTERA 667 mg (equivalent to 500 mg of ceftobiprole) administered as a 2-hour IV infusion every 6 hours from Day 1 to Day 8, and ZEVTERA 667 mg every 8 hours from Day 9 onwards, and 198 patients were treated with a comparator (daptomycin administered as an IV 0.5 hour infusion, 6 mg/kg up to 10 mg/kg every 24 hours, with optional aztreonam). The dose of study drugs were adjusted based on renal function. The median age of patients treated with ZEVTERA was 57 years, ranging between 20-89 years old with approximately 30% aged greater than or equal to 65 years. Patients treated with ZEVTERA were predominantly male (68%), White (95%), and from Europe (93%). The median duration of treatment was 21 days in both treatment arms. Serious Adverse Reactions and Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation In TRIAL 1, a total of 36/191 (18.8%) patients with SAB treated with ZEVTERA and 45/198 (22.7%) of patients with SAB treated with daptomycin \u00b1 aztreonam experienced serious adverse reactions. Discontinuation of treatment due to any adverse reaction occurred in 18/191 (9.4%) of patients treated with ZEVTERA, and 18/198 (9.1%) of patients treated with daptomycin \u00b1 aztreonam. In patients treated with ZEVTERA, the most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were nausea, vomiting, rash, and urticaria, each occurring in 2/191 (1%).

In the subgroup of patients with HABP, 53/283 patients treated with ZEVTERA died (18.7%) versus 60/284 patients treated with ceftazidime \u00b1 linezolid (21.1%). Common Adverse Reactions in Adult Patients Common adverse reactions occurring in >2% of HABP/VABP patients who received ceftobiprole in TRIAL 4 include diarrhea, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hepatic enzyme increased, vomiting, anemia, rash, phlebitis, nausea, abdominal pain, and seizures. Selected Adverse Reactions of ZEVTERA in Adult Patients The following selected adverse reactions were reported in ZEVTERA-treated adult patients at a rate of less than 2% in Trials 1, 2, 3 and 4. Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Thrombocytosis, Thrombocytopenia Gastrointestinal disorders: Dyspepsia, Dysphagia General disorders and administration site conditions: Fatigue, Chills, Facial swelling, Infusion site pain Immune system disorders: Hypersensitivity, Angioedema, Anaphylactic shock Infections and infestations: Mucocutaneous fungal infections Investigations: Blood lactate dehydrogenase increased, Blood triglycerides increased, Prothrombin time prolonged Psychiatric disorders: Anxiety, Irritability, Renal and urinary disorders: Pollakiuria Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: Bronchospasm, Wheezing Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Pruritus Vascular disorders: Thrombosis Pediatric Patients Clinical Trials Experience in Pediatric Patients with Community-Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia ZEVTERA was evaluated in an active-controlled, randomized, investigator-blind, multicenter phase 3 study in pediatric patients aged from 3 months to less than 18 years with HABP or CABP requiring hospitalization. Although patients with HABP are included in the safety data, the safety and effectiveness of ZEVTERA for the treatment of HABP has not been established and ZEVTERA is not approved for HABP. In TRIAL 5, 94 patients received ZEVTERA 13.3 mg/kg (equivalent to 10 mg/kg of ceftobiprole) to 26.7 mg/kg (equivalent to 20 mg/kg of ceftobiprole \u2013 higher than the recommended approved dose) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.4) ]. ZEVTERA was administered by intravenous infusion every 8 hours, age-adjusted for dose and infusion duration (2-hour or 4-hour infusion). In the comparator arm, 44 patients received either ceftriaxone 50-80 mg/kg IV as a single daily dose (maximum 2 grams/day) for CABP or ceftazidime 50 mg/kg IV every 8 hours (maximum 6 grams/day) for HABP, with or without vancomycin 10-15 mg/kg IV every 6 hours (maximum 2 grams/day). The median age of study patients was 5 years, ranging from 0.6 to 17 years. All patients were from Europe, 100% were classified as White and 56% of patients were male. Serious Adverse Reactions and Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation in Pediatric Patients In TRIAL 5, a total of 7/94 (7.4%) pediatric patients treated with ZEVTERA and 2/44 (4.5%) patients in the comparator group experienced serious adverse reactions. Discontinuation of treatment due to any adverse reaction occurred in 4/94 (4.3%) of patients treated with ZEVTERA and 0/44 patients treated in the comparator group. Specific adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation in patients who received ZEVTERA included aggravated pneumonia, pleuritis, urticaria, and hypersensitivity, each occurring in 1/94 (1.1%). There were no deaths in either arm of the pediatric study. The most common selected adverse reactions, occurring in \u2265 2% of pediatric patients treated with ceftobiprole, were vomiting (7.4%) headache (3.2%), hepatic enzyme increased (including alanine aminotransferase increased and aspartate aminotransferase increased) (3.2%), diarrhea, infusion site reaction, phlebitis, and pyrexia (all 2.1%). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions and altered laboratory tests have been identified during post-approval use of ZEVTERA and ceftobiprole outside of the United States, or other cephalosporin-class antibacterial drugs. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Altered Laboratory Tests : Positive direct Coombs' test, false-positive test for urinary glucose. Blood and lymphatic system disorders : Agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia. Hepatobiliary disorders : Hepatic dysfunction including cholestasis Immune system disorders : Drug fever, serum sickness-like reaction Nervous system disorders : Myoclonus Renal and urinary disorders : Renal dysfunction, toxic nephropathy Vascular disorders : Hemorrhage, hypertension"

Table 4 ZEVTERA Recommended Dosage Regimens for Pediatric Patients (2 Years to less than 18 Years Old) with CABP and with Renal Impairment Pediatric Age Group Duration of treatment for CABP in pediatric patients (2 years to less than 18 years old) and with renal impairment is 7 days to 14 days. eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) Calculate using a validated GFR estimating equation for the approved age of the pediatric population. Dosage Regimen 667 mg ceftobiprole medocaril sodium is equivalent to 500 mg of ceftobiprole; 333 mg ceftobiprole medocaril sodium is equivalent to 250 mg of ceftobiprole; 10 mg/kg of ceftobiprole medocaril sodium is equivalent to 7.5 mg/kg of ceftobiprole; 13.3 mg/kg ceftobiprole medocaril sodium is equivalent to 10 mg/kg of ceftobiprole 12 years to less than 18 years old 30 to less than 50 10 mg/kg (up to 667 mg) Administer each prepared intravenous infusion solution of ZEVTERA over 2 hours at a concentration of 2.67 mg/mL for pediatric patients 12 years to less than 18 years old [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. every 12 hours 15 to less than 30 10 mg/kg (up to 333 mg) every 12 hours 6 years to less than 12 years old 30 to less than 50 10 mg/kg (up to 667 mg) Administer each prepared intravenous infusion solution of ZEVTERA over 2 hours at a concentration of 5.33 mg/mL for pediatric patients 2 years to less than 12 years old [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. every 12 hours 15 to less than 30 10 mg/kg (up to 333 mg) every 24 hours 2 years to less than 6 years old 30 to less than 50 13.3 mg/kg every 12 hours (up to 667 mg) 15 to less than 30 13.3 mg/kg every 24 hours (up to 333 mg) 2.5 Preparation of ZEVTERA Infusion Solution ZEVTERA must first be reconstituted in the vial and then further diluted prior to administration by intravenous infusion over a period of 2 hours. Aseptic technique must be followed in preparing the infusion solution. See additional instructions for reconstitution and dilution below. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. The solution for infusion should be clear to slightly opalescent and yellowish in color. Discard if discoloration or visible particles are observed. Reconstitution of ZEVTERA in the Vial For adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older, reconstitute ZEVTERA lyophilized powder in the vial with 10 mL of sterile water for injection or 10 mL of 5% dextrose injection. For pediatric patients aged 3 months to less than 12 years old, ZEVTERA lyophilized powder must be reconstituted with 10 mL of 5% dextrose injection. After reconstitution, shake the reconstituted ZEVTERA vial vigorously until dissolution is completed, which in some cases may take up to 10 minutes. The volume of the resulting reconstituted solution is approximately 10.6 mL. Allow any foam formed to dissipate, and then inspect the reconstituted solution visually to ensure the product is in solution and particulate matter is absent. The reconstituted solution contains 66.7 mg/mL of ceftobiprole medocaril sodium and must be further diluted using aseptic technique with the appropriate diluent as described below, prior to administration. If it is not possible to dilute the reconstituted solution immediately, the reconstituted solution may be stored refrigerated for up to 24 hours, and at room temperature for up to 1 hour. Discard any unused reconstituted solution [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . Dilution of Reconstituted ZEVTERA Solution and Administration of the Diluted Product After reconstitution with the appropriate diluent, further dilute the reconstituted ZEVETRA solution, using aseptic technique with the appropriate diluent, to the appropriate volume of ZEVTERA infusion solution as described in Table 5 below.

    "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE ZEVTERA is a cephalosporin antibacterial indicated for the treatment of: Adult patients with Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections (bacteremia) (SAB), including those with right-sided infective endocarditis ( 1.1 ), Adult patients with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) ( 1.2 ), and Adult and pediatric patients (3 months to less than 18 years old) with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) ( 1.3 ). To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of ZEVTERA and other antibacterial drugs, ZEVTERA should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria ( 1.4 ). 1.1 Staphylococcus aureus Bloodstream Infection (Bacteremia) ZEVTERA is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infection (bacteremia) (SAB), including those with right-sided infective endocarditis, caused by methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant isolates . 1.2 Acute Bacterial Skin and Skin Structure Infections ZEVTERA is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) caused by susceptible isolates of the following gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant isolates), Streptococcus pyogenes, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. 1.3 Community-Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia ZEVTERA is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients (3 months to less than 18 years old) with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) caused by susceptible isolates of the following gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae , Haemophilus parainfluenzae , Escherichia coli , and Klebsiella pneumoniae. 1.4 Usage To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of ZEVTERA and other antibacterial drugs, ZEVTERA should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven, or strongly suspected, to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."
