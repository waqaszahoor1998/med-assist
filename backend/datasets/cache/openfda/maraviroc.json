    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022 Coadministration with CYP3A inhibitors, including protease inhibitors (except tipranavir/ritonavir), will increase the concentration of maraviroc. ( 7.1 ) \u2022 Coadministration with CYP3A inducers, including efavirenz, may decrease the concentration of maraviroc. ( 7.1 ) \u2022 Coadministration with St. John\u2019s wort is not recommended. ( 7.1 ). 7.1 Effect of Concomitant Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics of Maraviroc Maraviroc is metabolized by CYP3A and is also a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp), organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1, and multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP)2. The pharmacokinetics of maraviroc are likely to be modulated by inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A and P-gp and may be modulated by inhibitors of OATP1B1 and MRP2. Therefore, a dosage adjustment may be required when maraviroc is coadministered with those drugs [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 , 2.4 ) ]. Concomitant use of maraviroc and St. John's wort ( Hypericum perforatum ) or products containing St. John's wort is not recommended. Coadministration of maraviroc with St. John's wort is expected to substantially decrease maraviroc concentrations and may result in suboptimal levels of maraviroc and lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to maraviroc. Additional drug interaction information is available [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]."

    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in other sections of the labeling: \u2022 Hepatotoxicity [ see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] \u2022 Severe Skin and Hypersensitivity Reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] \u2022 Cardiovascular Events [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ] \u2022 The most common adverse events in treatment-experienced adult subjects (greater than 8% incidence) which occurred at a higher frequency compared with placebo are upper respiratory tract infections, cough, pyrexia, rash, and dizziness. ( 6.1 ) \u2022 The most common adverse events in treatment-naive adult subjects (greater than 8% incidence) which occurred at a higher frequency than the comparator arm are upper respiratory tract infections, bronchitis, flatulence, bloating and distention, upper respiratory tract signs and symptoms, and gastrointestinal atonic and hypomotility disorders. ( 6.1 ) \u2022 The most common adverse reactions in treatment-experienced pediatric subjects (greater than or equal to 3% incidence) are vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and dizziness.

Clinical Trials Experience in Adult Subjects Treatment-Experienced Subjects: The safety profile of maraviroc is primarily based on 840 HIV-1-infected subjects who received at least 1 dose of maraviroc during two Phase 3 trials. A total of 426 of these subjects received the indicated twice-daily dosing regimen. Assessment of treatment-emergent adverse events is based on the pooled data from 2 trials in subjects with CCR5-tropic HIV-1 (A4001027 and A4001028). The median duration of therapy with maraviroc for subjects in these trials was 48 weeks, with the total exposure on maraviroc twice daily at 309 patient-years versus 111 patient-years on placebo each administered with optimized background therapy (OBT). The population was 89% male and 84% white, with mean age of 46 years (range: 17 to 75 years). Subjects received dose equivalents of 300 mg maraviroc once or twice daily. The most common adverse events reported with twice-daily therapy with maraviroc with frequency rates higher than placebo, regardless of causality, were upper respiratory tract infections, cough, pyrexia, rash, and dizziness. In these 2 trials, the rate of discontinuation due to adverse events was 5% for subjects who received maraviroc twice daily + OBT as well as those who received placebo + OBT. Most of the adverse events reported were judged to be mild to moderate in severity. The data described below occurred with twice-daily dosing of maraviroc. The total numbers of subjects reporting infections were 233 (55%) and 84 (40%) in the group receiving maraviroc twice daily and the placebo group, respectively. Correcting for the longer duration of exposure on maraviroc compared with placebo, the exposure-adjusted frequency (rate per 100 subject-years) of these events was 133 for both maraviroc twice daily and placebo. Dizziness or postural dizziness occurred in 8% of subjects on either maraviroc or placebo, with 2 subjects (0.5%) on maraviroc permanently discontinuing therapy (1 due to syncope, 1 due to orthostatic hypotension) versus 1 subject on placebo (0.5%) permanently discontinuing therapy due to dizziness. Treatment-emergent adverse events, regardless of causality, from Trials A4001027 and A4001028 are summarized in Table 5. Selected events occurring at greater than or equal to 2% of subjects and at a numerically higher rate in subjects treated with maraviroc are included; events that occurred at the same or higher rate on placebo are not displayed.

Less Common Adverse Events in Clinical Trials: The following adverse events occurred in less than 2% of subjects treated with maraviroc or at a rate similar to the comparator. These events have been included because of their seriousness and either increased frequency on maraviroc or are potential risks due to the mechanism of action.

Clinical Trials Experience in Pediatric Subjects HIV-1\u2013Infected Pediatric Subjects: Trial A4001031 is an open-label trial in which 103 treatment-experienced, CCR5-tropic, HIV-1\u2013infected pediatric subjects aged 2 to less than 18 years weighing at least 10 kg received maraviroc twice daily in combination with OBT. The dose of maraviroc was based on body surface area (BSA) and on whether the subject was receiving potent CYP3A inhibitors and/or inducers. The median duration of therapy with maraviroc was 131 weeks with 72% of subjects receiving study treatment for greater than 48 weeks and 62% of subjects receiving study treatment for 96 weeks. In these 103 children and adolescents, the safety profile through 96 weeks was similar to that for adults. Most of the adverse reactions reported were mild to moderate; severe (Grade 3 and 4) adverse reactions occurred in 2% of subjects. The most common adverse reactions (all grades) reported with twice-daily therapy with maraviroc were vomiting (12%), abdominal pain (4%), diarrhea (4%), nausea (4%), and dizziness (3%). Three subjects (3%) discontinued due to adverse events. Maraviroc-related gastrointestinal adverse events through 48 weeks (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and abdominal pain/cramps) were observed more commonly in subjects who received the maraviroc oral solution (21%) compared with those who received maraviroc tablets (16%). Subjects were permitted to change formulations after Week 48. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse events have been identified during post-approval use of maraviroc. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)."

( 2.5 ) 2.1 Testing prior to Initiation of Maraviroc Tablets Prior to initiation of maraviroc tablets for treatment of HIV-1 infection, test all patients for CCR5 tropism using a highly sensitive tropism assay. Maraviroc tablets are recommended for patients with only CCR5-tropic HIV-1 infection. Outgrowth of pre-existing low-level CXCR4- or dual/mixed-tropic HIV-1 not detected by tropism testing at screening has been associated with virologic failure on maraviroc tablets [ see Microbiology ( 12.4 ), Clinical Studies ( 14.1 ) ]. Monitor patients for ALT, AST, and bilirubin prior to initiation of maraviroc tablets and at other time points during treatment as clinically indicated [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . 2.2 General Dosing Recommendations \u2022 Maraviroc tablets are taken twice daily by mouth and may be taken with or without food. \u2022 Maraviroc tablets must be given in combination with other antiretroviral medications. \u2022 The recommended dosage of maraviroc tablets differs based on concomitant medications due to drug interactions. 2.3 Recommended Dosage in Adult Patients with Normal Renal Function Table 1 displays oral dosage of maraviroc tablets based on different concomitant medications [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 ) ].
