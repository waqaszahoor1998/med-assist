    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Drugs Having Clinically Important Interactions with Lurasidone Table 34: Clinically Important Drug Interactions with Lurasidone Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of lurasidone hydrochloride tablets with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors increased the exposure of lurasidone compared to the use of lurasidone hydrochloride tablets alone [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Intervention: Lurasidone hydrochloride tablets should not be used concomitantly with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors [ see Contraindications (4) ]. Examples: Ketoconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir, voriconazole, mibefradil Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitors Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of lurasidone hydrochloride tablets with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors increased the exposure of lurasidone compared to the use of lurasidone hydrochloride tablets alone [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Intervention: Lurasidone hydrochloride tablets dose should be reduced to half of the original level when used concomitantly with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 [ see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Examples: Diltiazem, atazanavir, erythromycin, fluconazole, verapamil Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of lurasidone hydrochloride tablets with strong CYP3A4 inducers decreased the exposure of lurasidone compared to the use of lurasidone hydrochloride tablets alone [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Intervention: Lurasidone hydrochloride tablets should not be used concomitantly with strong CYP3A4 inducers [ see Contraindications (4) ]. Examples: Rifampin, avasimibe, St. John's wort, phenytoin, carbamazepine Moderate CYP3A4 Inducers Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of lurasidone hydrochloride tablets with moderate CYP3A4 inducers decreased the exposure of lurasidone compared to the use of lurasidone hydrochloride tablets alone [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Intervention: Lurasidone hydrochloride tablets dose should be increased when used concomitantly with moderate inducers of CYP3A4 [ see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Examples: Bosentan, efavirenz, etravirine, modafinil, nafcillin 7.2 Drugs Having No Clinically Important Interactions with Lurasidone \u200b Based on pharmacokinetic studies, no dosage adjustment of lurasidone hydrochloride is required when administered concomitantly with lithium, valproate, or substrates of P-gp or CYP3A4 [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

Adults The information below is derived from an integrated clinical study database for lurasidone hydrochloride tablets consisting of 3,799 adult patients exposed to one or more doses of lurasidone hydrochloride tablets for the treatment of schizophrenia, and bipolar depression in placebo-controlled studies. This experience corresponds with a total experience of 1,250.9 patient-years. A total of 1,106 lurasidone hydrochloride tablets-treated patients had at least 24 weeks and 371 lurasidone hydrochloride tablets-treated patients had at least 52 weeks of exposure. Adverse events during exposure to study treatment were obtained by general inquiry and voluntarily reported adverse experiences, as well as results from physical examinations, vital signs, ECGs, weights and laboratory investigations. Adverse experiences were recorded by clinical investigators using their own terminology. In order to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events, events were grouped in standardized categories using MedDRA terminology. Schizophrenia The following findings are based on the short-term, placebo-controlled premarketing adult studies for schizophrenia in which lurasidone hydrochloride tablets was administered at daily doses ranging from 20 to 160 mg (n=1,508). Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions: The most common adverse reactions (incidence \u22655% and at least twice the rate of placebo) in patients treated with lurasidone hydrochloride tablets were somnolence, akathisia, extrapyramidal symptoms, and nausea. Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment: A total of 9.5% (143/1,508) lurasidone hydrochloride tablets-treated patients and 9.3% (66/708) of placebo-treated patients discontinued due to adverse reactions. There were no adverse reactions associated with discontinuation in subjects treated with lurasidone hydrochloride tablets that were at least 2% and at least twice the placebo rate. Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of 2% or More in Lurasidone Hydrochloride Tablets-Treated Patients: Adverse reactions associated with the use of lurasidone hydrochloride tablets (incidence of 2% or greater, rounded to the nearest percent and lurasidone hydrochloride tablets incidence greater than placebo) that occurred during acute therapy (up to 6 weeks in patients with schizophrenia) are shown in Table 19.

Dystonia Class Effect: Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first-generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. Schizophrenia Adults In the short-term, placebo-controlled schizophrenia clinical studies, dystonia occurred in 4.2% of lurasidone hydrochloride tablets-treated subjects (0.0% lurasidone hydrochloride tablets 20 mg, 3.5% lurasidone hydrochloride tablets 40 mg, 4.5% lurasidone hydrochloride tablets 80 mg, 6.5% lurasidone hydrochloride tablets 120 mg and 2.5% lurasidone hydrochloride tablets 160 mg) compared to 0.8% of subjects receiving placebo. Seven subjects (0.5%, 7/1,508) discontinued clinical trials due to dystonic events \u2013 four were receiving lurasidone hydrochloride tablets 80 mg/day and three were receiving lurasidone hydrochloride tablets 120 mg/day. Adolescents In the short-term, placebo-controlled, adolescent schizophrenia study, dystonia occurred in 1% of lurasidone hydrochloride tablets-treated patients (1% lurasidone hydrochloride tablets 40 mg and 1% lurasidone hydrochloride tablets 80 mg) compared to 0% of patients receiving placebo. No patients discontinued the clinical study due to dystonic events. Bipolar Depression Adults Monotherapy In the adult short-term, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy bipolar depression study, dystonia occurred in 0.9% of lurasidone hydrochloride tablets-treated subjects (0.0% and 1.8% for lurasidone hydrochloride tablets 20 to 60 mg/day and lurasidone hydrochloride tablets 80 to 120 mg/day, respectively) compared to 0.0% of subjects receiving placebo. No subject discontinued the clinical study due to dystonic events. Adjunctive Therapy with Lithium or Valproate In the adult short-term, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled adjunctive therapy bipolar depression studies, dystonia occurred in 1.1% of lurasidone hydrochloride tablets-treated subjects (20 to 120 mg) compared to 0.6% of subjects receiving placebo. No subject discontinued the clinical study due to dystonic events. Pediatric Patients (10 to 17 years) In the 6-week, placebo-controlled bipolar depression study in pediatric patients 10 to 17 years, dystonia occurred in 0.6% of lurasidone hydrochloride tablets-treated patients compared to 1.2% of patients receiving placebo. No patients discontinued the clinical study due to dystonic events. Other Adverse Reactions Observed During the Premarketing Evaluation of Lurasidone Hydrochloride Tablets Following is a list of adverse reactions reported by adult patients treated with lurasidone hydrochloride tablets at multiple doses of \u226520 mg once daily within the premarketing database of 2,905 patients with schizophrenia.

Moderate and Severe Hepatic Impairment: Recommended starting dose is 20 mg per day. The maximum recommended dose is 80 mg per day in moderate hepatic impairment and 40 mg per day in severe hepatic impairment ( 2.5 , 8.7 ). Concomitant Use of a Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., diltiazem): Lurasidone hydrochloride tablets dose should be reduced to half of the original dose level. Recommended starting dose is 20 mg per day. Maximum recommended dose is 80 mg per day ( 2.6 , 7.1 ). Concomitant Use of a Moderate CYP3A4 Inducer: It may be necessary to increase the dose of lurasidone hydrochloride tablets ( 2.6 , 7.1 ). 2.1 Schizophrenia Adults The recommended starting dose of lurasidone hydrochloride tablet is 40 mg once daily. Initial dose titration is not required. Lurasidone hydrochloride tablets have been shown to be effective in a dose range of 40 mg per day to 160 mg per day [ see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . The maximum recommended dose is 160 mg per day. Adolescents (13 to 17 years) The recommended starting dose of lurasidone hydrochloride tablet is 40 mg once daily. Initial dose titration is not required. Lurasidone hydrochloride tablets have been shown to be effective in a dose range of 40 mg per day to 80 mg per day [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 ) ] . The maximum recommended dose is 80 mg per day. 2.2 Depressive Episodes Associated with Bipolar I Disorder Adults The recommended starting dose of lurasidone hydrochloride tablet is 20 mg given once daily as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate. Initial dose titration is not required. Lurasidone hydrochloride tablets have been shown to be effective in a dose range of 20 mg per day to 120 mg per day as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 ) ]. The maximum recommended dose, as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate, is 120 mg per day. In the monotherapy study, the higher dose range (80 mg to 120 mg per day) did not provide additional efficacy, on average, compared to the lower dose range (20 to 60 mg per day) [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . Pediatric Patients (10 to 17 years) The recommended starting dose of lurasidone hydrochloride tablet is 20 mg given once daily as monotherapy. Initial dose titration is not required. The dose may be increased after one week based on clinical response. Lurasidone hydrochloride tablets have been shown to be effective in a dose range of 20 mg per day to 80 mg per day as monotherapy. At the end of the clinical study, most of the patients (67%) received 20 mg or 40 mg once daily [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . The maximum recommended dose is 80 mg per day. The efficacy of lurasidone hydrochloride tablets in the treatment of mania associated with bipolar disorder has not been established. 2.3 Administration Information Lurasidone hydrochloride tablets should be taken with food (at least 350 calories). Administration with food substantially increases the absorption of lurasidone. Administration with food increases the AUC approximately 2-fold and increases the C max approximately 3-fold. In the clinical studies, lurasidone hydrochloride tablets were administered with food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The effectiveness of lurasidone hydrochloride tablets for longer-term use, that is, for more than 6 weeks, has not been established in controlled studies. Therefore, the physician who elects to use lurasidone hydrochloride tablets for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 and 2.2 )] . 2.4 Dose Modifications for Renal Impairment Dose adjustment is recommended in moderate (creatinine clearance: 30 to <50 mL/min) and severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) patients. The recommended starting dose is 20 mg per day. The dose in these patients should not exceed 80 mg per day [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 2.5 Dose Modifications for Hepatic Impairment Dose adjustment is recommended in moderate (Child-Pugh Score = 7 to 9) and severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Score = 10 to 15) patients. The recommended starting dose is 20 mg per day. The dose in moderate hepatic impairment patients should not exceed 80 mg per day and the dose in severe hepatic impairment patients should not exceed 40 per mg/day [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. 2.6 Dose Modifications Due to Drug Interactions of CYP3A4 Inhibitors and CYP3A4 Inducers Concomitant Use with CYP3A4 Inhibitors Lurasidone hydrochloride tablets should not be used concomitantly with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., ketoconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir, voriconazole, mibefradil, etc.) [see Contraindications (4) ] . If lurasidone hydrochloride tablets are being prescribed and a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g. diltiazem, atazanavir, erythromycin, fluconazole, verapamil etc.) is added to the therapy, the lurasidone hydrochloride tablets dose should be reduced to half of the original dose level. Similarly, if a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor is being prescribed and lurasidone hydrochloride tablets are added to the therapy, the recommended starting dose of lurasidone hydrochloride tablets is 20 mg per day, and the maximum recommended dose of lurasidone hydrochloride tablets is 80 mg per day [see Contraindications (4) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Grapefruit and grapefruit juice should be avoided in patients taking lurasidone hydrochloride tablets, since these may inhibit CYP3A4 and alter lurasidone concentrations [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . Concomitant Use with CYP3A4 Inducers Lurasidone hydrochloride tablets should not be used concomitantly with a strong CYP3A4 inducer (e.g., rifampin, avasimibe, St. John\u2019s wort, phenytoin, carbamazepine, etc.) [see Contraindications (4) ; Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . If lurasidone hydrochloride tablets are used concomitantly with a moderate CYP3A4 inducer, it may be necessary to increase the lurasidone hydrochloride tablets dose after chronic treatment (7 days or more) with the CYP3A4 inducer."
