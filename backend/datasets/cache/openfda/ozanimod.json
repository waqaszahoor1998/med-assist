    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Tables 5 and 6 include drugs with clinically important drug and vaccine interactions when administered concomitantly with ZEPOSIA and instructions for preventing or managing them. Table 5: Clinically Relevant Interactions Affecting Drugs and Vaccines Co-administered with ZEPOSIA Anti-Neoplastic, Immune-Modulating, or Non-Corticosteroid Immunosuppressive Therapies Clinical Impact: ZEPOSIA has not been studied in combination with anti-neoplastic, immune-modulating, or non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive therapies with the exception of cyclosporine, which had no pharmacokinetic interaction [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Prevention or Management: Caution should be used during concomitant administration because of the risk of additive immune effects during such therapy and in the weeks following administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . When switching from drugs with prolonged immune effects, the half-life and mode of action of these drugs must be considered in order to avoid unintended additive immunosuppressive effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] . Alemtuzumab : Initiating treatment with ZEPOSIA after alemtuzumab is not recommended because of the characteristics and duration of alemtuzumab immune suppressive effects. Beta interferon or glatiramer acetate : ZEPOSIA can generally be started immediately after discontinuation of beta interferon or glatiramer acetate. Anti-Arrhythmic Drugs, QT Prolonging Drugs, Drugs That May Decrease Heart Rate Clinical Impact: ZEPOSIA has not been studied in patients taking QT prolonging drugs. Class Ia (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) and Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) anti-arrhythmic drugs have been associated with cases of Torsades de Pointes in patients with bradycardia. Prevention or Management: If treatment with ZEPOSIA is considered in patients on Class Ia or Class III anti-arrhythmic drugs, advice from a cardiologist should be sought [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Because of the potential additive effects on heart rate, treatment with ZEPOSIA should generally not be initiated in patients who are concurrently treated with QT prolonging drugs with known arrhythmogenic properties [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. If treatment initiation with ZEPOSIA is considered in patients on QT prolonging drugs, advice from a cardiologist should be sought. Combination Beta Blocker and Calcium Channel Blocker Clinical Impact : The co-administration of ZEPOSIA with both a beta blocker and a calcium channel blocker has not been studied. However, there is a potential of additive effects on heart rate. Prevention or Management: Treatment with ZEPOSIA should generally not be initiated in patients who are concurrently treated with both a heart rate lowering calcium channel blocker (e.g., verapamil, diltiazem) and beta blocker [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. If treatment initiation with ZEPOSIA is considered in patients on both a heart rate lowering calcium channel blocker and beta blocker, advice from a cardiologist should be sought. Vaccination Clinical Impact: During, and for up to three months after, discontinuation of treatment with ZEPOSIA, vaccinations may be less effective. The use of live attenuated vaccines may carry the risk of infection. Prevention or Management: Live attenuated vaccines should be avoided during ZEPOSIA treatment and for up to 3 months after discontinuation of treatment with ZEPOSIA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Table 6: Clinically Relevant Interactions Affecting ZEPOSIA When Co-administered with Other Drugs Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) Inhibitors Clinical Impact: The effect of MAO inhibition on ozanimod and/or its metabolites has not been studied clinically. Potential effects on efficacy or safety with co-administration of MAO inhibitors because of altered exposures of ozanimod and/or its metabolites cannot be ruled out. Prevention or Management: Co-administration of ZEPOSIA with MAO inhibitors (e.g., selegiline, phenelzine, linezolid) is contraindicated. At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of ZEPOSIA and initiation of treatment with MAO inhibitors. Strong CYP2C8 Inhibitors Clinical Impact: Co-administration of ZEPOSIA with strong CYP2C8 inhibitors increases the exposure of the active metabolites of ozanimod [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] , which may increase the risk of ZEPOSIA adverse reactions. Prevention or Management: Co-administration of ZEPOSIA with strong CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g., gemfibrozil) is not recommended. Strong CYP2C8 Inducers Clinical Impact: Co-administration of ZEPOSIA with strong CYP2C8 inducers (e.g., rifampin) reduces the exposure of the major active metabolites of ozanimod [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] , which may decrease the efficacy of ZEPOSIA. Prevention or Management: Co-administration of ZEPOSIA with strong CYP2C8 inducers should be avoided. \u2022 Vaccination : Avoid use of live attenuated vaccines during and for up to 3 months after treatment with ZEPOSIA.

Respiratory Effects Dose-dependent reductions in absolute FEV 1 and FVC were observed in MS and UC patients treated with ZEPOSIA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. Malignancies Malignancies, such as melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, breast cancer, seminoma, cervical carcinoma, and adenocarcinomas, including rectal adenocarcinoma, were reported with ZEPOSIA in controlled trials of MS and UC. An increased risk of cutaneous malignancies has been reported with S1P receptor modulators [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ]. Hypersensitivity Hypersensitivity, including rash and urticaria, has been reported with ZEPOSIA in active-controlled MS clinical trials. Peripheral Edema Peripheral edema was observed in 3% of ZEPOSIA-treated patients and in 0.4% of patients who received placebo in UC Study 2. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of ZEPOSIA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

If a dose is missed after the first 2 weeks of treatment, continue treatment as planned. ( 2.4 ) 2.1 Assessments Prior to First Dose of ZEPOSIA Before initiation of treatment with ZEPOSIA, assess the following: Cardiac Evaluation Obtain an electrocardiogram (ECG) to determine whether preexisting conduction abnormalities are present. In patients with certain preexisting conditions, advice from a cardiologist should be sought [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Complete Blood Count Obtain a recent (i.e., within the last 6 months or after discontinuation of prior MS or UC therapy) complete blood count (CBC), including lymphocyte count [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Liver Function Tests Obtain recent (i.e., within the last 6 months) transaminase and bilirubin levels [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Ophthalmic Assessment Obtain a baseline evaluation of the fundus, including the macula, near the start of treatment with ZEPOSIA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. Skin Examination Obtain a baseline skin examination prior to or shortly after initiation of ZEPOSIA. If a suspicious skin lesion is observed, it should be promptly evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ]. Current or Prior Medications \u2022 If patients are taking anti-neoplastic, non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive, or immune-modulating therapies, or if there is a history of prior use of these drugs, consider possible unintended additive immunosuppressive effects before initiating treatment with ZEPOSIA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Drug Interactions (7) ] . \u2022 Determine if patients are taking drugs that could slow heart rate or atrioventricular conduction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Drug Interactions (7) ]. Vaccinations Patients without a healthcare professional-confirmed history of chickenpox or without documentation of a full course of vaccination against varicella zoster virus (VZV) should be tested for antibodies to VZV before initiating ZEPOSIA; VZV vaccination of antibody-negative patients is recommended prior to commencing treatment with ZEPOSIA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Drug Interactions (7) ].
