    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022 Strong CYP3A Inhibitors : Avoid concomitant use. If concomitant use cannot be avoided, reduce TRUQAP dose. ( 2.5 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors: Reduce TRUQAP dose. ( 2.5 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Strong and Moderate CYP3A Inducers: Avoid concomitant use. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on TRUQAP Table 6 describes drug interactions where concomitant use of another drug affects TRUQAP. Table 6: Drug Interactions with TRUQAP Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Clinical Impact \u2022 Capivasertib is a CYP3A substrate. Strong CYP3A inhibitors increase capivasertib exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ], which may increase the risk of TRUQAP adverse reactions. Prevention or Management \u2022 Avoid concomitant use with a strong CYP3A inhibitor. If concomitant use cannot be avoided, reduce the dose of TRUQAP and monitor patients for adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Clinical Impact \u2022 Capivasertib is a CYP3A substrate. Moderate CYP3A inhibitors increase capivasertib exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ], which may increase the risk of TRUQAP adverse reactions. Prevention or Management \u2022 When concomitantly used with moderate CYP3A inhibitor, reduce the dose of TRUQAP and monitor patients for adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . Strong and Moderate CYP3A Inducers Clinical Impact \u2022 Capivasertib is a CYP3A substrate. Strong and moderate CYP3A inducers decrease capivasertib exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ], which may reduce the effectiveness of TRUQAP. Prevention or Management \u2022 Avoid concomitant use of TRUQAP with strong or moderate CYP3A inducers."

    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are also discussed in greater details in other sections of the labeling: \u2022 Hyperglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] \u2022 Diarrhea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] \u2022 Cutaneous Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Most common adverse reactions (incidence \u226520%), including laboratory abnormalities, were diarrhea, cutaneous adverse reactions, increased random glucose, decreased lymphocytes, decreased hemoglobin, increased fasting glucose, nausea, fatigue, decreased leukocytes, increased triglycerides, decreased neutrophils, increased creatinine, vomiting and stomatitis. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact AstraZeneca at 1-800-236-9933 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety population described in WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to TRUQAP 400 mg orally, twice a day for 4 days followed by 3 days off, in combination with fulvestrant, in 355 patients in CAPItello-291 until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Among the 355 patients who received TRUQAP, 52% were exposed for 6 months or longer, and 27% were exposed for greater than one year. In this safety population, the most common (\u2265 20%) adverse reactions including laboratory abnormalities were diarrhea (72%), cutaneous adverse reactions (58%), increased random glucose (57%), decreased lymphocytes (47%), decreased hemoglobin (45%), increased fasting glucose (37%), nausea and fatigue (35% each), decreased leukocytes (32%), increased triglycerides (27%), decreased neutrophils (23%), increased creatinine (22%), vomiting (21%), and stomatitis (20%). CAPItello-291 The safety of TRUQAP was evaluated in CAPItello-291, a clinical trial including 288 adult patients (155 patients in TRUQAP with fulvestrant arm and 133 patients in placebo with fulvestrant arm) whose breast cancer had one or more PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN -alterations [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Among patients who received TRUQAP, 61% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 30% were exposed for greater than one year. Of the 155 patients who received TRUQAP with fulvestrant, the median age was 58 years (range 36 to 84); female (99%); White (48%), Asian (31%), Black (1.3%), American Indian/Alaska Native (0.6%), and other races (19%). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 18% of patients receiving TRUQAP with fulvestrant. The most common serious adverse reactions (\u2265 1%) were cutaneous adverse reaction (3.9%), diarrhea and pneumonia (2.6% each), vomiting and pyrexia (1.9% each), hyperglycemia, hypersensitivity, fatigue, renal injury and second malignancy (1.3% each). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 1.3% of patients who received TRUQAP with fulvestrant, including sepsis (0.6%), and acute myocardial infarction (0.6%). Permanent TRUQAP discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 10% of patients. The most common adverse reaction (\u2265 2%) leading to permanent discontinuation of TRUQAP was cutaneous adverse reactions (6%). Dosage interruptions of TRUQAP due to an adverse reaction occurred in 39% of patients. Adverse reactions leading to dosage interruption in \u2265 2% of patients included cutaneous adverse reactions (14%), diarrhea (10%), pyrexia (4.5%), vomiting and nausea (3.2% each), and fatigue (2.6%). Dose reductions of TRUQAP due to adverse reactions occurred in 21% of patients receiving TRUQAP with fulvestrant. Adverse reactions leading to TRUQAP dose reductions in \u2265 2% of patients were diarrhea and cutaneous adverse reactions (8% each). The most common (\u2265 20%) adverse reactions including laboratory abnormalities were diarrhea (77%), increased random glucose (58%), cutaneous adverse reaction (56%), decreased lymphocytes (49%), decreased hemoglobin (47%), fatigue (38%), increased fasting glucose (37%), nausea and decreased leukocytes (35% each), increased triglycerides (30%), stomatitis (25%), decreased neutrophils (25%), and vomiting (21%).

Do not chew, crush, or split tablets prior to swallowing. Do not take tablets that are broken, cracked, or otherwise not intact. If a patient misses a dose within 4 hours of the scheduled time, instruct the patient to take the missed dose. If a patient misses a dose more than 4 hours of the scheduled time, instruct the patient to skip the dose and take the next dose at its usual scheduled time. If a patient vomits a dose, instruct the patient not to take an additional dose and take the next dose at its usual scheduled time. Refer to the fulvestrant Full Prescribing Information for recommended fulvestrant dosing information. For premenopausal and perimenopausal women, administer a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist according to current clinical practice standards. For men, consider administering a LHRH agonist according to current clinical practice standards. 2.4 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions The recommended dose reductions for adverse reactions are listed in Table 2.

FG > 500 mg/dL or FG > 27.8 mmol/L or life-threatening sequelae of hyperglycemia at any FG level Withhold TRUQAP. For life-threatening sequelae of hyperglycemia or if FG persists at \u2265 500 mg/dL after 24 hours, permanently discontinue TRUQAP. If FG \u2264 500 mg/dL (or \u2264 27.8 mmol/L) within 24 hours, then follow the guidance in the table for the relevant grade Diarrhea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Grade 2 Withhold TRUQAP until recovery to \u2264 Grade 1.

If recovery occurs in \u2264 28 days, resume TRUQAP at same dose or one lower dose as clinically indicated. If recovery occurs in > 28 days, permanently discontinue TRUQAP. Grade 4 Permanently discontinue TRUQAP. Cutaneous Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Grade 2 Withhold TRUQAP until recovery to \u2264 Grade 1. Resume TRUQAP at the same dose. Persistent or recurrent: reduce TRUQAP by one lower dose. Grade 3 Withhold TRUQAP until recovery to \u2264 Grade 1. If recovery occurs in \u2264 28 days, resume TRUQAP at same dose.

If concomitant use with a strong CYP3A inhibitor cannot be avoided, reduce the dosage of TRUQAP to 320 mg orally twice daily for 4 days followed by 3 days off [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . When concomitantly used with a moderate CYP3A inhibitor, reduce the dosage of TRUQAP to 320 mg orally twice daily for 4 days followed by 3 days off. After discontinuation of a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor, resume the TRUQAP dosage (after 3 to 5 half-lives of the inhibitor) that was taken prior to initiating the strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor."
