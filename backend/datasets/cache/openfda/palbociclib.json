    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Palbociclib is primarily metabolized by CYP3A and sulfotransferase (SULT) enzyme SULT2A1. In vivo, palbociclib is a time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A. \u2022 CYP3A Inhibitors: Avoid concurrent use of IBRANCE with strong CYP3A inhibitors. If the strong inhibitor cannot be avoided, reduce the IBRANCE dose. ( 2.2 , 7.1 ) \u2022 CYP3A Inducers: Avoid concurrent use of IBRANCE with strong CYP3A inducers. ( 7.2 ) \u2022 CYP3A Substrates: The dose of sensitive CYP3A4 substrates with narrow therapeutic indices may need to be reduced when given concurrently with IBRANCE. ( 7.3 ) 7.1 Agents That May Increase Palbociclib Plasma Concentrations Effect of CYP3A Inhibitors Coadministration of a strong CYP3A inhibitor (itraconazole) increased the plasma exposure of palbociclib in healthy subjects by 87%. Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir/ritonavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, telithromycin, and voriconazole). Avoid grapefruit or grapefruit juice during IBRANCE treatment. If coadministration of IBRANCE with a strong CYP3A inhibitor cannot be avoided, reduce the dose of IBRANCE [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.2 Agents That May Decrease Palbociclib Plasma Concentrations Effect of CYP3A Inducers Coadministration of a strong CYP3A inducer (rifampin) decreased the plasma exposure of palbociclib in healthy subjects by 85%. Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers (e.g., phenytoin, rifampin, carbamazepine, enzalutamide, and St John's Wort) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.3 Drugs That May Have Their Plasma Concentrations Altered by Palbociclib Coadministration of midazolam with multiple doses of IBRANCE increased the midazolam plasma exposure by 61%, in healthy subjects, compared to administration of midazolam alone. The dose of the sensitive CYP3A substrate with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., alfentanil, cyclosporine, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, everolimus, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, and tacrolimus) may need to be reduced, as IBRANCE may increase its exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

PALOMA-2: IBRANCE plus Letrozole Patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer for initial endocrine\u2011based therapy The safety of IBRANCE (125 mg/day) plus letrozole (2.5 mg/day) versus placebo plus letrozole was evaluated in PALOMA-2. The data described below reflect exposure to IBRANCE in 444 out of 666 patients with ER-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who received at least 1 dose of IBRANCE plus letrozole in PALOMA-2. The median duration of treatment for IBRANCE plus letrozole was 19.8 months while the median duration of treatment for placebo plus letrozole arm was 13.8 months. Dose reductions due to an adverse reaction of any grade occurred in 36% of patients receiving IBRANCE plus letrozole. No dose reduction was allowed for letrozole in PALOMA-2. Permanent discontinuation associated with an adverse reaction occurred in 43 of 444 (10%) patients receiving IBRANCE plus letrozole and in 13 of 222 (6%) patients receiving placebo plus letrozole. Adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation for patients receiving IBRANCE plus letrozole included neutropenia (1.1%) and alanine aminotransferase increase (0.7%). The most common adverse reactions (\u226510%) of any grade reported in patients in the IBRANCE plus letrozole arm by descending frequency were neutropenia, infections, leukopenia, fatigue, nausea, alopecia, stomatitis, diarrhea, anemia, rash, asthenia, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, decreased appetite, dry skin, pyrexia, and dysgeusia. The most frequently reported Grade \u22653 adverse reactions (\u22655%) in patients receiving IBRANCE plus letrozole by descending frequency were neutropenia, leukopenia, infections, and anemia.
