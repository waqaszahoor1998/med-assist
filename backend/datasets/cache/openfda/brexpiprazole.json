    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Factors Dosage Adjustments for REXULTI ( 2.7 ) Strong CYP2D6 REXULTI may be administered without dosage adjustment in patients with MDD when administered with strong CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., paroxetine, fluoxetine). or CYP3A4 inhibitors Administer half of recommended dosage. Strong/moderate CYP2D6 with Strong/moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors Administer a quarter of the recommended dosage. Known CYP2D6 poor metabolizers taking strong/moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors Administer a quarter of the recommended dosage. Strong CYP3A4 inducers Double the recommended dosage and further adjust based on clinical response. 7.1 Drugs Having Clinically Important Interactions with REXULTI See Table 12 for clinically important drug interactions with REXULTI. Table 12 Clinically Important Drug Interactions with REXULTI Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of REXULTI with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors increased the exposure of brexpiprazole compared to the use of REXULTI alone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Intervention: With concomitant use of REXULTI with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, reduce the REXULTI dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . Strong CYP2D6 Inhibitors In the clinical studies examining the adjunctive use of REXULTI in the treatment of MDD, dosage was not adjusted for strong CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., paroxetine, fluoxetine). Thus, CYP considerations are already factored into general dosing recommendations, and REXULTI may be administered without dosage adjustment in patients with MDD. Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of REXULTI with strong CYP2D6 inhibitors increased the exposure of brexpiprazole compared to the use of REXULTI alone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Intervention: With concomitant use of REXULTI with a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor, reduce the REXULTI dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . Both CYP3A4 Inhibitors and CYP2D6 Inhibitors Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of REXULTI with 1) a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor; or 2) a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor and a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor; or 3) a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor; or 4) a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor and a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor increased the exposure of brexpiprazole compared to the use of REXULTI alone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Intervention: With concomitant use of REXULTI with 1) a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor; or 2) a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor and a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor; or 3) a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor; or 4) a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor and a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor, decrease the REXULTI dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ]. Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of REXULTI and a strong CYP3A4 inducer decreased the exposure of brexpiprazole compared to the use of REXULTI alone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Intervention: With concomitant use of REXULTI with a strong CYP3A4 inducer, increase the REXULTI dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ]. 7.2 Drugs Having No Clinically Important Interactions with REXULTI Based on pharmacokinetic studies, no dosage adjustment of REXULTI is required when administered concomitantly with CYP2B6 inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine) or gastric pH modifiers (e.g., omeprazole). Additionally, no dosage adjustment for substrates of CYP2D6 (e.g., dextromethorphan), CYP3A4 (e.g., lovastatin), CYP2B6 (e.g., bupropion), BCRP (e.g., rosuvastatin), or P-gp (e.g., fexofenadine) is required when administered concomitantly with REXULTI."

The most common adverse reactions in adult patients in clinical trials (\u22655%) were weight increased, akathisia, headache, somnolence, and insomnia. The most common adverse reactions in pediatric patients in clinical trials (\u22655%) were weight increased, somnolence, headache, akathisia, and nasopharyngitis. Brexpiprazole has been evaluated for safety in 12,550 adult patients who participated in multiple-dose clinical trials for major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), bipolar mania, and borderline personality disorder (BPD). Among them, 3,870 patients were treated with brexpiprazole for at least 180 days, and 1,910 patients were treated for at least one year of exposure. Additionally, brexpiprazole has been evaluated for safety in 119 pediatric patients who participated in short-term trials, and 314 patients in long-term multiple-dose clinical trials for pediatric schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Adjunctive Treatment in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) The safety of REXULTI was evaluated in 1054 adult patients (18 to 65 years of age) diagnosed with MDD who participated in two 6-week placebo-controlled, fixed-dose clinical studies in patients with major depressive disorder in which REXULTI was administered at doses of 1 mg to 3 mg daily as adjunctive treatment to continued antidepressant therapy; patients in the placebo group continued to receive antidepressant therapy [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Adverse Reactions Reported as Reasons for Discontinuation of Treatment A total of 3% (17/643) of REXULTI-treated patients and 1% (3/411) of placebo-treated patients discontinued due to adverse reactions. Adverse Reactions in REXULTI Studies for Adjunctive MDD in Adults Adverse reactions associated with the adjunctive use of REXULTI (incidence of 2% or greater and adjunctive REXULTI incidence greater than adjunctive placebo) that occurred during acute therapy (up to 6-weeks in patients with MDD) are shown in Table 8.

The incidence of akathisia events for REXULTI plus ADT-treated patients was 9% versus 2% for placebo plus ADT-treated patients. In the 6-week placebo-controlled MDD studies, data was objectively collected on the Simpson-Angus Rating Scale (SAS) for EPS, the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS) for akathisia and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Score (AIMS) for dyskinesia. The mean change from baseline at last visit for REXULTI plus ADT-treated patients for the SAS, BARS and AIMS was comparable to placebo-treated patients. The percentage of patients who shifted from normal to abnormal was greater in REXULTI plus ADT-treated patients versus placebo plus ADT-treated patients for the BARS (4% versus 0.6%) and the SAS (4% versus 3%). Schizophrenia(Adults) The incidence of reported EPS-related adverse reactions, excluding akathisia, was 5% for REXULTI-treated adult patients versus 4% for placebo-treated patients. The incidence of akathisia events for REXULTI-treated adult patients was 6% versus 5% for placebo-treated patients. In the 6-week placebo-controlled, fixed-dose schizophrenia studies in adults, data was objectively collected on the Simpson-Angus Rating Scale (SAS) for EPS, the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS) for akathisia and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) for dyskinesia. The mean change from baseline at last visit for REXULTI-treated patients for the SAS, BARS and AIMS was comparable to placebo-treated patients. The percentage of patients who shifted from normal to abnormal was greater in REXULTI-treated patients versus placebo for the BARS (2% versus 1%) and the SAS (7% versus 5%). Schizophrenia [Pediatric Patients (13 to 17 years of age)] The incidence of reported EPS-related adverse reactions, excluding akathisia, was 6.4% for REXULTI-treated pediatric patients versus 2.9% for placebo-treated patients. The incidence of akathisia events for REXULTI-treated pediatric patients was 3.6% versus 2.9% for placebo-treated patients. In the 6-week placebo-and active controlled, schizophrenia study in pediatric patients, data was objectively collected on the Simpson-Angus Rating Scale (SAS) for EPS, the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS) for akathisia and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) for dyskinesia. The mean change from baseline at last visit for REXULTI-treated pediatric patients for the SAS, BARS and AIMS was comparable to placebo-treated patients. The percentage of patients who shifted from normal to abnormal was greater in REXULTI-treated patients versus placebo for the BARS (0.9% versus 0%) and the SAS (5.5% versus 2.9%). Agitation Associated with Dementia Due to Alzheimer's Disease The incidence of reported EPS-related adverse reactions, excluding akathisia, was 3% for REXULTI-treated patients versus 2% for placebo-treated patients. The incidence of akathisia events for REXULTI-treated patients was 1% versus 0% for placebo-treated patients. In the 12-week placebo-controlled, fixed-dose studies in agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, data was objectively collected on the Simpson-Angus Rating Scale (SAS) for EPS, the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS) for akathisia and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) for dyskinesia. The mean change from baseline at last visit for REXULTI-treated patients for the SAS, BARS and AIMS was comparable to placebo-treated patients. The percentage of patients who shifted from normal to abnormal was greater in REXULTI-treated patients versus placebo for the SAS (6% versus 2%). Dystonia Symptoms of dystonia may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first-generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. Other Adverse Reactions Observed during Clinical Trial Evaluation of REXULTI Other adverse reactions (\u22651% frequency and greater than placebo) within the short-term, placebo-controlled trials in adult patients with MDD and schizophrenia are shown below. The following listing does not include adverse reactions: 1) already listed in previous tables or elsewhere in the labeling, 2) for which a drug cause was remote, 3) which were so general as to be uninformative, 4) which were not considered to have clinically significant implications, or 5) which occurred at a rate equal to or less than placebo. Eye Disorders: Vision Blurred Gastrointestinal Disorders: Nausea, Dry Mouth, Salivary Hypersecretion, Abdominal Pain, Flatulence Investigations: Blood Prolactin Increased Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: Myalgia Psychiatric Disorders: Abnormal Dreams Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Hyperhidrosis Pediatric Patients (13 to 17 years of age) In a short-term, randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled study in pediatric patients 13 to 17 years of age with schizophrenia, safety was assessed in 110 patients in which 100 received REXULTI for at least 6 weeks. In an on-going, 2 year, open-label study in pediatric patients 13 to 17 years of age with schizophrenia, in which safety was assessed in 194 patients of which 140 received REXULTI for at least 6 months. Adverse reactions reported in clinical studies for this age group were generally similar to those observed in adult patients. Hyperprolactinemia In a 6-week, placebo-controlled study in pediatric patients with schizophrenia, a 3.3 ng/mL mean increase (from baseline to last visit) was observed in the REXULTI group (versus a 2.8 ng/mL mean decrease in the placebo group) in females. Additionally, more female subjects in the REXULTI group (28.9%, n=13) compared to the placebo group (4.7%, n=2) had shifts from normal (\u226430 ng/mL) prolactin levels at baseline to abnormal (>30 ng/mL) during the course of treatment. In males, overall mean shifts in the REXULTI group were not consistent with an increase in prolactin however, more male subjects in the REXULTI group (21.4%, n=9) compared to the placebo group (7.0%, n=3) had shifts from normal (\u226420 ng/mL) prolactin levels at baseline to abnormal (>20 ng/mL) during the course of treatment. One subject in the study experienced TEAE of galactorrhea without elevated prolactin. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reaction has been identified during post-approval use of REXULTI. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
