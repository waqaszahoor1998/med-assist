    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to the rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Most common adverse reactions (5% to 10%) are capsular opacity, decreased visual acuity, foreign body sensation, increased intraocular pressure, and sticky sensation. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Harrow Eye, LLC at 844-446-6979 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Serious and Otherwise Important Adverse Reactions The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of labeling.

These reactions occurred in approximately 5% to 10% of patients. Other ocular adverse reactions occurring at an incidence of approximately 1% to 5% included conjunctival edema, corneal edema, dry eye, lid margin crusting, ocular discomfort, ocular hyperemia, ocular pain, ocular pruritus, photophobia, tearing, and vitreous detachment. Some of these reactions may be the consequence of the cataract surgical procedure. 6.3 Non-Ocular Adverse Reactions Non-ocular adverse reactions reported at an incidence of 1% to 4% included headache, hypertension, nausea/vomiting, and sinusitis."
