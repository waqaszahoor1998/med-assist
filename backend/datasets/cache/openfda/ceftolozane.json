( 6.1 ). The most common adverse reactions (\u22655% in the HABP/VABP indication) are increase in hepatic transaminases, renal impairment/renal failure, and diarrhea. ( 6.1 ) Pediatric cIAI and cUTI Patients: The most common adverse reactions in pediatric patients (\u22657% in either the cIAI or cUTI indication) are thrombocytosis, diarrhea, pyrexia, leukopenia, abdominal pain, vomiting, increased aspartate aminotransferase, and anemia. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC at 1-877-888-4231 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and also may not reflect rates observed in practice. Adult Patients Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections and Complicated Urinary Tract Infections, Including Pyelonephritis ZERBAXA was evaluated in Phase 3 comparator-controlled clinical trials of cIAI and cUTI, which included a total of 1015 patients treated with ZERBAXA (1.5 g every 8 hours, adjusted based on renal function where appropriate) and 1032 patients treated with comparator (levofloxacin 750 mg daily in cUTI or meropenem 1 g every 8 hours in cIAI) for up to 14 days. The mean age of treated patients was 48 to 50 years (range 18 to 92 years), across treatment arms and indications. In both indications, about 25% of the subjects were 65 years of age or older. Most patients (75%) enrolled in the cUTI trial were female, and most patients (58%) enrolled in the cIAI trial were male. Most patients (>70%) in both trials were enrolled in Eastern Europe and were White. The most common adverse reactions (5% or greater in either indication) occurring in patients receiving ZERBAXA were nausea, diarrhea, headache, and pyrexia. Table 6 lists adverse reactions occurring in 1% or greater of patients receiving ZERBAXA in Phase 3 cIAI and cUTI clinical trials. Table 6: Adverse Reactions Occurring in 1% or Greater of Adult Patients (18 years and older) Receiving ZERBAXA in Phase 3 cIAI and cUTI Clinical Trials Adverse Reaction Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections Complicated Urinary Tract Infections, Including Pyelonephritis ZERBAXA The ZERBAXA for injection dose was 1.5 g intravenously every 8 hours, adjusted to match renal function where appropriate. In the cIAI trials, ZERBAXA was given in conjunction with metronidazole.

Renal impairment (including the terms renal impairment, renal failure, and renal failure acute) led to discontinuation of treatment in 5/1015 (0.5%) subjects receiving ZERBAXA and none in the comparator arms. Increased Mortality In the cIAI trials (Phase 2 and 3), death occurred in 2.5% (14/564) of patients receiving ZERBAXA and in 1.5% (8/536) of patients receiving meropenem. The causes of death varied and included worsening and/or complications of infection, surgery, and underlying conditions. Less Common Adverse Reactions in Phase 3 cIAI and cUTI Clinical Trials The following selected adverse reactions were reported in ZERBAXA-treated subjects at a rate of less than 1%: Cardiac disorders: tachycardia, angina pectoris Gastrointestinal disorders: gastritis, abdominal distension, dyspepsia, flatulence, ileus paralytic General disorders and administration site conditions: infusion site reactions Infections and infestations: candidiasis including oropharyngeal and vulvovaginal, fungal urinary tract infection Investigations: increased serum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), increased serum alkaline phosphatase, positive Coombs\u2019 test Metabolism and nutrition disorders: hyperglycemia, hypomagnesemia, hypophosphatemia Nervous system disorders: ischemic stroke Renal and urinary system: renal impairment, renal failure Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders: dyspnea Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: urticaria Vascular disorders: venous thrombosis Hospital-acquired Bacterial Pneumonia and Ventilator-associated Bacterial Pneumonia (HABP/VABP) ZERBAXA was evaluated in a Phase 3 comparator-controlled clinical trial for HABP/VABP, which included a total of 361 patients treated with ZERBAXA (3 g every 8 hours, adjusted based on renal function where appropriate) and 359 patients treated with comparator (meropenem 1 g every 8 hours) for up to 14 days. The mean age of treated patients was 60 years (range 18 to 98 years), across treatment arms. About 44% of the subjects were 65 years of age or older. Most patients (71%) enrolled in the trial were male. All subjects were mechanically ventilated at randomization and 92% were in an intensive care unit (ICU) at randomization. The median APACHE II score was 17, and 33% of subjects had a baseline APACHE II score of \u226520, indicating a high severity of illness for many patients enrolled in this trial. Table 7 lists adverse reactions occurring in 2% or greater of patients receiving ZERBAXA in a Phase 3 HABP/VABP clinical trial.

Less Common Adverse Reactions in a Phase 3 HABP/VABP Clinical Trial The following selected adverse reactions were reported in ZERBAXA-treated subjects at a rate of less than 2%: Investigations: blood alkaline phosphatase increased, gamma-glutamyltransferase increased, Coombs direct test positive Pediatric Patients Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections and Complicated Urinary Tract Infections, Including Pyelonephritis ZERBAXA was evaluated in two blinded, randomized, active-controlled clinical studies in pediatric patients from birth to less than 18 years of age, one in cIAI and the other in cUTI, which included a total of 170 pediatric patients treated with ZERBAXA and 54 pediatric patients treated with the comparator. The ZERBAXA dosing regimen was the same in each trial [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Patients were randomized 3:1 to receive ZERBAXA plus metronidazole or meropenem plus placebo in the cIAI study and ZERBAXA or meropenem in the cUTI study [see Clinical Studies [(14.1 , 14.2) ] . In these pediatric patients, the type of adverse reactions were generally comparable to those observed in adults. Table 8 lists adverse reactions occurring in 4% or greater of pediatric patients receiving ZERBAXA in either the pediatric cIAI or cUTI clinical trial.

Aseptic technique must be followed in preparing the infusion solution. Preparation of doses: Constitute each vial of ZERBAXA with 10 mL of sterile water for injection or 0.9% Sodium Chloride for Injection, USP and gently shake to dissolve. The final volume is approximately 11.4 mL per vial. Caution: The constituted solution is not for direct injection. To prepare the required dose, withdraw the appropriate volume determined from Table 4 from the reconstituted vial(s). Add the withdrawn volume to an infusion bag containing 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride for Injection, USP or 5% Dextrose Injection, USP. For doses above 1.5 g, reconstitute a second vial in the same manner as the first one, withdraw an appropriate volume (per Table 4), and add to the same infusion bag. Discard unused portion. Table 4: Preparation of Doses ZERBAXA (ceftolozane and tazobactam) Dose Volume to Withdraw from Reconstituted Vial(s) 3 g (2 g and 1 g) Two vials of 11.4 mL each (entire contents from two vials) 2.25 g (1.5 g and 0.75 g) 11.4 mL from one vial (entire contents) and 5.7 mL from a second vial 1.5 g (1 g and 0.5 g) 11.4 mL (entire contents from one vial) 750 mg (500 mg and 250 mg) 5.7 mL 450 mg (300 mg and 150 mg) 3.5 mL 375 mg (250 mg and 125 mg) 2.9 mL 150 mg (100 mg and 50 mg) 1.2 mL Inspect drug products visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to use. ZERBAXA infusions range from clear, colorless solutions to solutions that are clear and slightly yellow. Variations in color within this range do not affect the potency of the product. 2.6 Compatibility Compatibility of ZERBAXA with other drugs has not been established. ZERBAXA should not be mixed with other drugs or physically added to solutions containing other drugs. 2.7 Storage of Constituted Solutions Upon constitution with sterile water for injection or 0.9% sodium chloride injection, reconstituted ZERBAXA solution may be held for 1 hour prior to transfer and dilution in a suitable infusion bag. Following dilution of the solution with 0.9% sodium chloride or 5% dextrose, ZERBAXA is stable for 24 hours when stored at room temperature or 7 days when stored under refrigeration at 2 to 8\u00b0C (36 to 46\u00b0F). Discard unused portion. Constituted ZERBAXA solution or diluted ZERBAXA infusion should not be frozen."
