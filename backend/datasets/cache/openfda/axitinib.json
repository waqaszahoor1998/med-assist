    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022 Avoid strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors. If unavoidable, reduce the INLYTA dose. ( 2.2 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Avoid strong CYP3A4/5 inducers. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 CYP3A4/5 Inhibitors Co-administration of ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4/5, increased the plasma exposure of axitinib in healthy volunteers. Co-administration of INLYTA with strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors should be avoided. Grapefruit or grapefruit juice may also increase axitinib plasma concentrations and should be avoided. Selection of concomitant medication with no or minimal CYP3A4/5 inhibition potential is recommended. If a strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor must be co-administered, the INLYTA dose should be reduced [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.2 CYP3A4/5 Inducers Co-administration of rifampin, a strong inducer of CYP3A4/5, reduced the plasma exposure of axitinib in healthy volunteers. Co-administration of INLYTA with strong CYP3A4/5 inducers (e.g., rifampin, dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital, and St. John's wort) should be avoided. Selection of concomitant medication with no or minimal CYP3A4/5 induction potential is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Moderate CYP3A4/5 inducers (e.g., bosentan, efavirenz, etravirine, modafinil, and nafcillin) may also reduce the plasma exposure of axitinib and should be avoided if possible."

The safety of INLYTA has been evaluated in combination with avelumab in JAVELIN Renal 101 and pembrolizumab in KEYNOTE-426 for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced RCC [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . The data described [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] reflect exposure to INLYTA in combination with avelumab in 434 patients and pembrolizumab in 429 patients [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . The safety of INLYTA has been evaluated in 715 patients in second-line monotherapy studies, which included 537 patients with advanced RCC. The data described [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] reflect exposure to INLYTA in 359 patients with advanced RCC who participated in a randomized clinical study versus sorafenib [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . First-Line Advanced RCC INLYTA in Combination with Avelumab The safety of INLYTA in combination with avelumab was evaluated in JAVELIN Renal 101. Patients with autoimmune disease other than type I diabetes mellitus, vitiligo, psoriasis, or thyroid disorders not requiring immunosuppressive treatment were excluded. Patients received INLYTA 5 mg twice daily (N=434) in combination with avelumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks administered or sunitinib 50 mg once daily for 4 weeks followed by 2 weeks off (N=439). In the INLYTA plus avelumab arm, 70% were exposed to avelumab for \u22656 months and 29% were exposed for \u22651 year in JAVELIN Renal 101 [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . The median age of patients treated with INLYTA in combination with avelumab was 62 years (range: 29 to 83), 38% of patients were 65 years or older, 71% were male, 75% were White, and the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score was 0 (64%) or 1 (36%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 1.8% of patients receiving INLYTA in combination with avelumab. These included sudden cardiac death (1.2%), stroke (0.2%), myocarditis (0.2%), and necrotizing pancreatitis (0.2%). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 35% of patients receiving INLYTA in combination with avelumab. Serious adverse reactions in \u22651% of patients included diarrhea (2.5%), dyspnea (1.8%), hepatotoxicity (1.8%), venous thromboembolic disease (1.6%), acute kidney injury (1.4%), and pneumonia (1.2%). Permanent discontinuation due to an adverse reaction of either INLYTA or avelumab occurred in 22% of patients: 19% avelumab only, 13% INLYTA only, and 8% both drugs. The most common adverse reactions (>1%) resulting in permanent discontinuation of avelumab or the combination were hepatotoxicity (6%) and infusion-related reaction (1.8%). Dose interruptions or reductions due to an adverse reaction, excluding temporary interruptions of avelumab infusions due to infusion-related reactions, occurred in 76% of patients receiving INLYTA in combination with avelumab. This includes interruption of avelumab in 50% of patients. INLYTA was interrupted in 66% and dose reduced in 19% of patients. The most common adverse reaction (>10%) resulting in interruption of avelumab was diarrhea (10%). The most common adverse reactions resulting in either interruption or dose reduction of INLYTA were diarrhea (19%), hypertension (18%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (18%), and hepatotoxicity (10%). The most common adverse reactions (\u226520%) in patients receiving INLYTA in combination with avelumab were diarrhea, fatigue, hypertension, musculoskeletal pain, nausea, mucositis, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, dysphonia, decreased appetite, hypothyroidism, rash, hepatotoxicity, cough, dyspnea, abdominal pain, and headache. Forty-eight (11%) of patients treated with INLYTA in combination with avelumab received an oral prednisone dose equivalent to \u226540 mg daily for an immune-mediated adverse reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] . Table 4 summarizes adverse reactions that occurred in \u226520% of INLYTA in combination with avelumab-treated patients.

Table 3 represents additional recommended dosage modifications for adverse reactions when INLYTA is administered in combination with avelumab or pembrolizumab. See the Full Prescribing Information for additional dosage information for avelumab or pembrolizumab including dose modifications for immune-mediated adverse reactions. Table 3: Recommended Dosage Modification for Adverse Reactions for INLYTA in Combination with Avelumab or Pembrolizumab Treatment Adverse Reaction Severity Based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0. Dosage Modifications for INLYTA ALT = alanine aminotransferase, AST = aspartate aminotransferase, ULN = upper limit normal INLYTA in combination with avelumab OR pembrolizumab Liver enzyme elevations Consider corticosteroid therapy ALT or AST at least 3 times ULN but less than 10 times ULN without concurrent total bilirubin at least 2 times ULN \u2022 Withhold both INLYTA and avelumab or pembrolizumab until resolution to Grades 0\u20131 \u2022 Consider rechallenge with INLYTA and/or avelumab or pembrolizumab If rechallenging with INLYTA, consider dosage reduction per Table 1. Consider rechallenge with a single drug or sequential rechallenge with both drugs after recovery. ALT or AST increases to more than 3 times ULN with concurrent total bilirubin at least 2 times ULN or ALT or AST at least 10 times ULN \u2022 Permanently discontinue both INLYTA and avelumab or pembrolizumab Diarrhea Grade 1\u20132 \u2022 Initiate symptomatic medications. Grade 3 \u2022 Interrupt INLYTA and initiate symptomatic medications. If diarrhea is controlled, INLYTA may be resumed at either the same dose or reduced by 1 dose level. Grade 4 \u2022 Withhold INLYTA until resolution to Grade <2, then restart INLYTA dose reduced by 1 dose level INLYTA in combination with avelumab Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) Grade 3 or 4 \u2022 Permanently discontinue 2.3 Dosage Modification for Drug Interactions Strong CYP3A4/5 Inhibitors The concomitant use of strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors should be avoided (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, and voriconazole). Selection of an alternate concomitant medication with no or minimal CYP3A4/5 inhibition potential is recommended. Although INLYTA dose adjustment has not been studied in patients receiving strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors, if a strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor must be co-administered, a dose decrease of INLYTA by approximately half is recommended, as this dose reduction is predicted to adjust the axitinib area under the plasma concentration vs time curve (AUC) to the range observed without inhibitors. The subsequent doses can be increased or decreased based on individual safety and tolerability. If co-administration of the strong inhibitor is discontinued, the INLYTA dose should be returned (after 3 \u2013 5 half-lives of the inhibitor) to that used prior to initiation of the strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 2.4 Dosage Modification for Hepatic Impairment No starting dose adjustment is required when administering INLYTA to patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A). Based on the pharmacokinetic data, the INLYTA starting dose should be reduced by approximately half in patients with baseline moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B). The subsequent doses can be increased or decreased based on individual safety and tolerability. INLYTA has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."
