    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant use of LAMPIT with alcohol may increase the incidence and severity of undesirable effects similar to other nitrofurans and nitroheterocyclic compounds. LAMPIT is contraindicated in patients who consume alcohol during treatment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) Contraindications ( 4 )]."

    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious or otherwise important adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: \u2022 Potential for Genotoxicity, Carcinogenicity, and Mutagenicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] \u2022 Worsening of Neurological and Psychiatric Conditions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] \u2022 Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] \u2022 Decreased Appetite and Weight Loss [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] \u2022 Porphyria [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] The most frequently reported adverse reactions (\u22655%) are vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, decreased appetite, nausea, pyrexia, and rash. ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-888-842-2937 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety data described below reflect exposure to LAMPIT in one prospective, randomized, double-blind trial (Trial 1). 330 pediatric patients with serologic evidence of T. cruzi infection and without Chagas disease-related cardiac or gastrointestinal symptoms were randomly assigned in a 2:1 fashion to a 60-day (n=219) or a 30-day (n=111) LAMPIT treatment regimen and were followed up for one year after end of treatment. LAMPIT was administered three times a day with food using a body weight-based dosing. The median treatment duration was 61 days for subjects in the 60-day regimen. The majority (86.7%) of the study population was \u22652 to <18 years of age at randomization. Discontinuation of LAMPIT due to adverse reactions occurred in 14 of 330 (4.2%) patients overall, 12 of 219 (5.5%) patients in the 60-day arm, and 2 of 111 (1.8%) patients in the 30-day arm. Adverse reactions were reported for 213 of 330 (64.5%) patients. The proportion of patients with adverse reactions was higher in the 60-day regimen (67.1%) compared with the 30-day regimen (59.5%). Most patients with adverse reactions had mild (76.5%) or moderate (22.0%) reactions. The most frequently reported adverse reactions in patients treated with LAMPIT for 60 days were vomiting (14.6%), abdominal pain (13.2%), headache (12.8%), decreased appetite (10.5%), nausea (8.2%), pyrexia (7.3%), rash (5.5%). Adverse reactions occurring in \u22651% of LAMPIT-treated patients are shown in Table 3 . Table 3 Adverse Reactions Reported in (\u22651%) Pediatric Patients with Chagas Disease in Trial 1 Treated with LAMPIT for 60 days System Organ Class Adverse Reactions Incidence Blood and lymphatic system disorders Anemia Eosinophilia 2.7% 2.3% Gastrointestinal disorders Vomiting Abdominal pain a Nausea Diarrhea 14.6% 13.2% 8.2% 4.6% General disorders and administration site conditions Pyrexia 7.3% Investigations Weight decreased 2.7% Metabolism and nutrition disorders Decreased appetite 10.5% Nervous system disorders Headache Dizziness 12.8% 2.7% Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Rash b Urticaria 5.5% 2.3% a Abdominal pain includes abdominal pain and abdominal pain upper b Rash includes rash, rash macular, rash maculo-papular, rash morbilliform, and rash papular. Other adverse reactions occurring in 0.1% to less than 1% of patients treated with LAMPIT for 60 days included asthenia, vertigo, arthralgia, myalgia, paresthesia, tremor, irritability, anxiety, pruritus, fatigue, somnolence, seizure, syncope, neutropenia, leukopenia. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following safety data were derived during postmarketing surveillance of nifurtimox from outside the United States, including literature data for all age groups (pediatric and adult populations). Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

( 2.2 ) \u2022 Obtain a pregnancy test in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating treatment with LAMPIT ( 2.3 , 8.3 ) . \u2022 See Full Prescribing Information for additional important administration instructions. ( 2.1 , 2.2 , 2.4, 2.5 ) 2.1 Important Administration Instructions \u2022 LAMPIT (30 mg and 120 mg) tablets are for oral use and must be taken with food. \u2022 LAMPIT tablets are dosed by body weight of the patient [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . \u2022 LAMPIT (30 mg and 120 mg) tablets are functionally scored tablets which can be split into one-half (15 mg and 60 mg respectively) at the scored lines by hand. Do not break LAMPIT tablets mechanically with a tablet splitting device [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) and Instructions for Use] . \u2022 LAMPIT 30 mg and 120 mg tablets can be made into a slurry as an alternative method of administration for patients who cannot swallow the tablets [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] . \u2022 Discontinue consumption of alcohol during treatment with LAMPIT [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . \u2022 Complete the full course of treatment to prevent recurrence of the infection. \u2022 If a dose is missed, take the missed dose as soon as possible together with food. However, if it is within 3 hours of the next scheduled dose, skip the missed dose and continue treatment as prescribed. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose. 2.2 Recommended Dosage in Pediatric Patients \u2022 Administer LAMPIT (30 mg and 120 mg) tablets orally three times a day with food. \u2022 Total daily recommended dosages of LAMPIT are based on the body weight of the patient (see Table 1 ). \u2022 Adjust LAMPIT dosage accordingly if body weight decreases during treatment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. \u2022 The recommended duration of treatment with LAMPIT is 60 days.

A functional score line is used to divide the tablet by hand as follows: \u2022 To split LAMPIT tablet, place the tablet on a flat surface with the score line facing up. \u2022 With the tablet resting on the flat surface, apply enough downward pressure with the index finger centered on the top of the tablet to break it along the score line. 2.5 Preparation of a Slurry of LAMPIT as an Alternate Method of Administration For patients who are unable to swallow whole or half tablets, LAMPIT tablet can be dispersed in water and administered as outlined below. \u2022 Place approximately 2.5 mL of water into a spoon. \u2022 Place the prescribed dose into the water. \u2022 Allow the tablet(s) to disintegrate (typically less than 30 seconds). \u2022 A slurry (liquid suspension) is formed. \u2022 Take the slurry immediately with food."
