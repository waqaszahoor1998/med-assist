    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022 Co-administration with probenecid inhibits the renal excretion of ertapenem and is therefore not recommended. ( 7.1 ) \u2022 The concomitant use of ertapenem and valproic acid/divalproex sodium is generally not recommended. Anti-bacterials other than carbapenems should be considered to treat infections in patients whose seizures are well controlled on valproic acid or divalproex sodium. ( 5.2 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Probenecid Probenecid interferes with the active tubular secretion of ertapenem, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of ertapenem [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Co-administration of probenecid with ertapenem is not recommended. 7.2 Valproic Acid Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including ertapenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction of valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Although the mechanism of this interaction is unknown, data from in vitro and animal studies suggest that carbapenems may inhibit the hydrolysis of valproic acid's glucuronide metabolite (VPA-g) back to valproic acid, thus decreasing the serum concentrations of valproic acid [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] ."

Adults Receiving Ertapenem for Injection as a Treatment Regimen Clinical trials enrolled 1954 patients treated with Ertapenem for Injection; in some of the clinical trials, parenteral therapy was followed by a switch to an appropriate oral antimicrobial [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Most adverse experiences reported in these clinical trials were described as mild to moderate in severity. Ertapenem for Injection was discontinued due to adverse experiences in 4.7% of patients. Table 3 shows the incidence of adverse experiences reported in \u22652% of patients in these trials. The most common drug-related adverse experiences in patients treated with Ertapenem for Injection, including those who were switched to therapy with an oral antimicrobial, were diarrhea (5.5%), infused vein complication (3.7%), nausea (3.1%), headache (2.2%), and vaginitis in females (2.1%).

These deaths occurred in patients with significant co-morbidity and/or severe baseline infections. Deaths were considered unrelated to study drugs by investigators.
