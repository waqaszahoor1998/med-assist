    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Co-administration of darunavir/ritonavir with other drugs can alter the concentrations of other drugs and other drugs may alter the concentrations of darunavir. The potential drug-drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy. ( 4 , 5.5 , 7 , 12.3 ) 7.1 Potential for Darunavir/ritonavir to Affect Other Drugs Darunavir co-administered with ritonavir is an inhibitor of CYP3A, CYP2D6 and P-gp. Co-administration of darunavir and ritonavir with drugs that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A and CYP2D6 or are transported by P-gp may result in increased plasma concentrations of such drugs, which could increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse events. Darunavir co-administered with ritonavir with drugs that have active metabolite(s) formed by CYP3A may result in reduced plasma concentrations of these active metabolite(s), potentially leading to loss of their therapeutic effect (see Table 10). 7.2 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Darunavir Darunavir and ritonavir are metabolized by CYP3A. In vitro data indicate that darunavir may be a P-gp substrate. Drugs that induce CYP3A activity would be expected to increase the clearance of darunavir and ritonavir, resulting in lowered plasma concentrations of darunavir and ritonavir. Co-administration of darunavir and ritonavir and other drugs that inhibit CYP3A or P-gp may decrease the clearance of darunavir and ritonavir and may result in increased plasma concentrations of darunavir and ritonavir (see Table 10). 7.3 Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions Table 10 provides dosing recommendations as a result of drug interactions with darunavir/ritonavir. These recommendations are based on either drug interaction studies or predicted interactions due to the expected magnitude of interaction and potential for serious adverse events or loss of efficacy. The table includes examples of potentially significant interactions but is not all inclusive [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , and therefore the label of each drug that is co-administered with darunavir/ritonavir should be consulted for information related to the route of metabolism, interaction pathways, potential risks, and specific actions to be taken with regard to co-administration. Table 10 Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions: Alterations in Dose or Regimen May be Recommended Based on Drug Interaction Studies or Predicted Interaction (see Contraindications ( 4 ) for a list of examples of contraindicated drugs) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) for Magnitude of Interaction, Tables 15 and 16] Concomitant Drug Class Drug Name Examples Effect on Concentration of Darunavir Or Concomitant Drug Clinical Comment HIV-1-Antiviral Agents: Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs) didanosine \u2194 darunavir \u2194 didanosine Didanosine should be administered one hour before or two hours after darunavir/ritonavir (which are administered with food). HIV-1-Antiviral Agents: HIV-Protease Inhibitors (PIs) indinavir (The reference regimen for indinavir was indinavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg twice daily.) \u2191 darunavir \u2191 indinavir The appropriate dose of indinavir in combination with darunavir/ritonavir has not been established. lopinavir/ritonavir \u2193 darunavir \u2194 lopinavir Appropriate doses of the combination have not been established. Hence, it is not recommended to co-administer lopinavir/ritonavir and darunavir, with or without ritonavir. saquinavir \u2193 darunavir \u2194saquinavir Appropriate doses of the combination have not been established. Hence, it is not recommended to co-administer saquinavir and darunavir, with or without ritonavir. Other HIV protease inhibitors, except atazanavir [see Drug Interactions (7.4)] As co-administration with darunavir/ritonavir has not been studied, co-administration is not recommended. HIV-1-Antiviral Agents: CCR5 co-receptor antagonists maraviroc \u2191 maraviroc When used in combination with darunavir/ritonavir, the dose of maraviroc should be 150 mg twice daily. Other Agents Alpha 1-adrenoreceptor antagonist: alfuzosin \u2191 alfuzosin Co-administration is contraindicated due to potential for serious and/or life-threatening reactions such as hypotension. Antibacterial: clarithromycin \u2194 darunavir \u2191 clarithromycin No dose adjustment of the combination is required for patients with normal renal function. For co-administration of clarithromycin and darunavir/ritonavir in patients with renal impairment, the following dose adjustments should be considered: For subjects with CLcr of 30 mL/min to 60 mL/min, the dose of clarithromycin should be reduced by 50%. For subjects with CLcr of < 30 mL/min, the dose of clarithromycin should be reduced by 75%. Anticoagulants : Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) apixaban \u2191 apixaban Due to potentially increased bleeding risk, dosing recommendations for co-administration of apixaban with darunavir/ritonavir depend on the apixaban dose. Refer to apixaban dosing instructions for co-administration with P-gp and strong CYP3A inhibitors in apixaban prescribing information. rivaroxaban \u2191 rivaroxaban Co-administration of darunavir/ritonavir and rivaroxaban is not recommended because it may lead to an increased bleeding risk. dabigatran etexilate edoxaban \u2191 dabigatran \u2191 edoxaban Refer to the dabigatran etexilate or edoxaban prescribing information for recommendations regarding co-administration. The specific recommendations are based on indication, renal function, and effect of the co-administered P-gp inhibitors on the concentration of dabigatran or edoxaban. Clinical monitoring is recommended when a DOAC not affected by CYP3A4 but transported by P-gp, including dabigatran etexilate and edoxaban, is co-administered with darunavir /ritonavir. Other Anticoagulants warfarin \u2193 warfarin \u2194 darunavir Warfarin concentrations are decreased when co-administered with darunavir/ritonavir.

Patients Co-Infected with Hepatitis B and/or Hepatitis C Virus In subjects co-infected with hepatitis B or C virus receiving darunavir/ritonavir, the incidence of adverse events and clinical chemistry abnormalities was not higher than in subjects receiving darunavir/ritonavir who were not co-infected, except for increased hepatic enzymes [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . The pharmacokinetic exposure in co-infected subjects was comparable to that in subjects without co-infection. Clinical Trials Experience: Pediatric Patients Darunavir/ritonavir has been studied in combination with other antiretroviral agents in 3 Phase 2 trials. TMC114-C212, in which 80 antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1-infected pediatric subjects 6 to less than 18 years of age and weighing at least 20 kg were included, TMC114-C228, in which 21 antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1-infected pediatric subjects 3 to less than 6 years of age and weighing at least 10 kg were included and TMC114-C230 in which 12 antiretroviral treatment-na\u00efve HIV-1 infected pediatric patients aged from 12 to less than 18 years and weighing at least 40 kg were included. The TMC114-C212 and C228 trials evaluated darunavir/ritonavir twice daily dosing and the TMC114-C230 trial evaluated darunavir/ritonavir once daily dosing [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14.4 )] . Frequency, type and severity of ADRs in pediatric subjects were comparable to those observed in adults. TMC114-C212 Clinical ADRs to darunavir/ritonavir (all grades, greater than or equal to 3%), were vomiting (13%), diarrhea (11%), abdominal pain (10%), headache (9%), rash (5%), nausea (4%) and fatigue (3%). Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities were ALT increased (Grade 3: 3%; Grade 4: 1%), AST increased (Grade 3: 1%), pancreatic amylase increased (Grade 3: 4%, Grade 4: 1%), pancreatic lipase increased (Grade 3: 1%), total cholesterol increased (Grade 3: 1%) and LDL increased (Grade 3: 3%). TMC114-C228 Clinical ADRs to darunavir/ritonavir (all grades, greater than or equal to 5%), were diarrhea (24%), vomiting (19%), rash (19%), abdominal pain (5%) and anorexia (5%). There were no Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities considered as ADRs in this trial. TMC114-C230 Clinical ADRs to darunavir/ritonavir (all grades, greater than or equal to 3%), were vomiting (33%), nausea (25%), diarrhea (16.7%), abdominal pain (8.3%), decreased appetite (8.3%), pruritus (8.3%) and rash (8.3%). There were no Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities considered as ADRs in this trial. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of darunavir. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: Redistribution of body fat Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: Rhabdomyolysis (associated with co-administration with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and darunavir/ritonavir) Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Toxic epidermal necrolysis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Renal and Urinary Disorders: Crystal nephropathy, crystalluria"

    "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Testing: In treatment-experienced patients, treatment history genotypic and/or phenotypic testing is recommended prior to initiation of therapy with darunavir/ritonavir to assess drug susceptibility of the HIV-1 virus ( 2.1 , 12.4 ) Monitor serum liver chemistry tests before and during therapy with darunavir/ritonavir. ( 2.1 , 2.2 , 5.2 ) Treatment-na\u00efve adult patients and treatment-experienced adult patients with no darunavir resistance associated substitutions: 800 mg (one 800 mg tablet) taken with ritonavir 100 mg once daily and with food. ( 2.3 ) Treatment-experienced adult patients with at least one darunavir resistance associated substitution: 600 mg (one 600 mg tablet) taken with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily and with food. ( 2.3 ) Pregnant patients: 600 mg (one 600 mg tablet) taken with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily and with food. ( 2.4 ) Pediatric patients (3 to less than 18 years of age and weighing at least 10 kg): dosage of darunavir and ritonavir is based on body weight and should not exceed the adult dose. Darunavir should be taken with ritonavir and with food. ( 2.5 ) Darunavir/ritonavir is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment. ( 2.6 ) 2.1 Testing Prior to Initiation of Darunavir/ritonavir In treatment-experienced patients, treatment history, genotypic and/or phenotypic testing is recommended to assess drug susceptibility of the HIV-1 virus [see Microbiology ( 12.4 )]. Refer to Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ), ( 2.4 ) and ( 2.5 ) for dosing recommendations. Appropriate laboratory testing such as serum liver biochemistries should be conducted prior to initiating therapy with darunavir/ritonavir [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. 2.2 Monitoring During Treatment with Darunavir/ritonavir Patients with underlying chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis or in patients who have pre-treatment elevations of transaminases should be monitored for elevation in serum liver biochemistries, especially during the first several months of darunavir/ritonavir treatment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. 2.3 Recommended Dosage in Adult Patients Darunavir must be co-administered with ritonavir to exert its therapeutic effect. Failure to correctly co-administer darunavir with ritonavir will result in plasma levels of darunavir that will be insufficient to achieve the desired antiviral effect and will alter some drug interactions. Patients who have difficulty swallowing darunavir tablets can use the 100 mg per mL darunavir oral suspension. Treatment-Na\u00efve Adult Patients The recommended oral dose of darunavir is 800 mg (one 800 mg tablet or 8 mL of the oral suspension) taken with ritonavir 100 mg (one 100 mg tablet or capsule or 1.25 mL of a 80 mg per mL ritonavir oral solution) once daily and with food. An 8 mL darunavir dose should be taken as two 4 mL administrations with the included oral dosing syringe. Treatment-Experienced Adult Patients The recommended oral dosage for treatment-experienced adult patients is summarized in Table 1. Baseline genotypic testing is recommended for dose selection. However, when genotypic testing is not feasible, darunavir 600 mg taken with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is recommended. Table 1 Recommended Darunavir/ritonavir Dosage in Treatment-Experienced Adult Patients a V11I, V32I, L33F, I47V, I50V, I54L, I54M, T74P, L76V, I84V and L89V b An 8 mL darunavir dose should be taken as two 4 mL administrations with the included oral dosing syringe Baseline Resistance Formulation and Recommended Dosing Darunavir tablets with ritonavir tablets or capsule Darunavir oral suspension (100 mg/mL) with ritonavir oral solution (80 mg/mL) With no darunavir resistance associated substitutions a One 800 mg darunavir tablet with one 100 mg ritonavir tablet/capsule, taken once daily with food 8 mL b darunavir oral suspension with 1.25 mL ritonavir oral solution, taken once daily with food With at least one darunavir resistance associated substitutions a , or with no baseline resistance information One 600 mg darunavir tablet with one 100 mg ritonavir tablet/capsule, taken twice daily with food 6 mL darunavir oral suspension with 1.25 mL ritonavir oral solution, taken twice daily with food 2.4 Recommended Dosage During Pregnancy The recommended dosage in pregnant patients is darunavir 600 mg taken with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily with food. Darunavir 800 mg taken with ritonavir 100 mg once daily should only be considered in certain pregnant patients who are already on a stable darunavir 800 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily regimen prior to pregnancy, are virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL) and in whom a change to twice daily darunavir 600 mg with ritonavir 100 mg may compromise tolerability or compliance. 2.5 Recommended Dosage in Pediatric Patients (age 3 to less than 18 years) Healthcare professionals should pay special attention to accurate dose selection of darunavir, transcription of the medication order, dispensing information and dosing instruction to minimize risk for medication errors, overdose and underdose. Prescribers should select the appropriate dose of darunavir/ritonavir for each individual child based on body weight (kg) and should not exceed the recommended dose for adults. Before prescribing darunavir, children weighing greater than or equal to 15 kg should be assessed for the ability to swallow tablets. If a child is unable to reliably swallow a tablet, the use of darunavir oral suspension should be considered. The recommended dose of darunavir/ritonavir for pediatric patients (3 to less than 18 years of age and weighing at least 10 kg is based on body weight (see Tables 2, 3, 4 and 5) and should not exceed the recommended adult dose. Darunavir should be taken with ritonavir and with food. The recommendations for the darunavir/ritonavir dosage regimens were based on pediatric clinical trial data and population pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )].
