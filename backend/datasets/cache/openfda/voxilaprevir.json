    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS P-gp inducers and/or moderate to strong CYP inducers (e.g., St. John's wort, carbamazepine): May decrease concentrations of sofosbuvir, velpatasvir, and/or voxilaprevir. Use of VOSEVI with P-gp inducers and/or moderate to strong CYP inducers is not recommended. ( 5.4 , 7 ) Consult the full prescribing information prior to use for potential drug interactions. ( 4 , 5.3 , 5.4 , 7 ) Clearance of HCV infection with direct acting antivirals may lead to changes in hepatic function, which may impact safe and effective use of concomitant medications. Frequent monitoring of relevant laboratory parameters (INR or blood glucose) and dose adjustments of certain concomitant medications may be necessary. ( 7.3 ) 7.1 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect VOSEVI Sofosbuvir, velpatasvir, and voxilaprevir are substrates of drug transporters P-gp and BCRP while GS-331007 (predominant circulating metabolite of sofosbuvir) is not. Voxilaprevir is also a substrate of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. In vitro, slow metabolic turnover of velpatasvir by CYP2B6, CYP2C8, and CYP3A4 and of voxilaprevir by CYP1A2, CYP2C8, and primarily CYP3A4 was observed. Drugs that are inducers of P-gp and/or moderate to strong inducers of CYP2B6, CYP2C8, or CYP3A4 (e.g., St. John's wort, carbamazepine) may significantly decrease plasma concentrations of sofosbuvir, velpatasvir, and/or voxilaprevir leading to reduced therapeutic effect of VOSEVI. The use of these agents with VOSEVI is not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. VOSEVI may be coadministered with P-gp, BCRP, and CYP inhibitors. The use of OATP inhibitors which may substantially increase exposure of voxilaprevir (e.g., cyclosporine) with VOSEVI is not recommended [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.2 Potential for VOSEVI to Affect Other Drugs Velpatasvir and voxilaprevir are inhibitors of drug transporters P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3. Velpatasvir is also an inhibitor of OATP2B1. Coadministration of VOSEVI with drugs that are substrates of these transporters may alter the exposure of such drugs. Coadministration of VOSEVI with BCRP substrates (e.g., methotrexate, mitoxantrone, imatinib, irinotecan, lapatinib, rosuvastatin, sulfasalazine, topotecan) is not recommended [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.3 Established and Potentially Significant Drug Interactions Clearance of HCV infection with direct acting antivirals may lead to changes in hepatic function, which may impact the safe and effective use of concomitant medications. For example, altered blood glucose control resulting in serious symptomatic hypoglycemia has been reported in diabetic patients in postmarketing case reports and published epidemiological studies. Management of hypoglycemia in these cases required either discontinuation or dose modification of concomitant medications used for diabetes treatment. Frequent monitoring of relevant laboratory parameters (e.g., International Normalized Ratio [INR] in patients taking warfarin, blood glucose levels in diabetic patients) or drug concentrations of concomitant medications such as cytochrome P450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., certain immunosuppressants) is recommended to ensure safe and effective use. Dose adjustments of concomitant medications may be necessary. Table 3 provides a listing of established or potentially clinically significant drug interactions. The drug interactions described are based on studies conducted with either VOSEVI, the components of VOSEVI (sofosbuvir, velpatasvir, and/or voxilaprevir), or are predicted drug interactions that may occur with VOSEVI [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Table 3 Potentially Significant Drug Interactions: Alteration in Dose or Regimen May Be Recommended Based on Drug Interaction Studies or Predicted Interaction This table is not all inclusive. Concomitant Drug Class: Drug Name Effect on Concentration \u2193 = decrease, \u2191 = increase. Clinical Effect/Recommendation Acid Reducing Agents: \u2193 velpatasvir Velpatasvir solubility decreases as pH increases. Drugs that increase gastric pH are expected to decrease concentration of velpatasvir. Antacids (e.g., aluminum and magnesium hydroxide) Separate antacid and VOSEVI administration by 4 hours. H 2 -receptor antagonists (e.g., famotidine) These interactions have been studied in healthy adults. H 2 -receptor antagonists may be administered simultaneously with or staggered from VOSEVI at a dose that does not exceed doses comparable with famotidine 40 mg twice daily. Proton-pump inhibitors (e.g., omeprazole) Omeprazole 20 mg can be administered with VOSEVI. Use with other proton pump-inhibitors has not been studied. Antiarrhythmics: amiodarone Effect on amiodarone, sofosbuvir, velpatasvir, and voxilaprevir concentrations unknown Coadministration of amiodarone with VOSEVI may result in serious symptomatic bradycardia. The mechanism of this effect is unknown. Coadministration of amiodarone with VOSEVI is not recommended; if coadministration is required, cardiac monitoring is recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. digoxin \u2191 digoxin Therapeutic concentration monitoring of digoxin is recommended when coadministered with VOSEVI. Refer to digoxin prescribing information for monitoring and dose modification recommendations for concentration increases with unclear magnitude. Anticoagulants: dabigatran etexilate \u2191 dabigatran Clinical monitoring of dabigatran is recommended when coadministered with VOSEVI. Refer to dabigatran etexilate prescribing information for dose modification recommendations in the setting of moderate renal impairment. Anticonvulsants: carbamazepine phenytoin phenobarbital \u2193 sofosbuvir \u2193 velpatasvir \u2193 voxilaprevir Coadministration is not recommended. Antimycobacterials: rifampin \u2193 sofosbuvir \u2193 velpatasvir \u2191 voxilaprevir (single dose) \u2193 voxilaprevir (multiple dose) Coadministration with rifampin is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) ]. rifabutin rifapentine \u2193 sofosbuvir \u2193 velpatasvir \u2193 voxilaprevir Coadministration is not recommended. Antiretrovirals: atazanavir lopinavir \u2191 voxilaprevir Coadministration of VOSEVI with atazanavir- or lopinavir-containing regimens is not recommended. tipranavir/ritonavir \u2193 sofosbuvir \u2193 velpatasvir Coadministration is not recommended. The effect on voxilaprevir is unknown. efavirenz \u2193 velpatasvir \u2193 voxilaprevir Coadministration of VOSEVI with efavirenz-containing regimens is not recommended. tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir DF) \u2191 tenofovir Monitor for tenofovir-associated adverse reactions in patients receiving VOSEVI concomitantly with a regimen containing tenofovir DF. Refer to the prescribing information of the tenofovir DF-containing product for recommendations on renal monitoring. Herbal Supplements: St. John's wort \u2193 sofosbuvir \u2193 velpatasvir \u2193 voxilaprevir Coadministration is not recommended. HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors: pravastatin \u2191 pravastatin Coadministration of VOSEVI with pravastatin has been shown to increase the concentration of pravastatin, which is associated with increased risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis. Pravastatin may be administered with VOSEVI at a dose that does not exceed pravastatin 40 mg. rosuvastatin \u2191 rosuvastatin Coadministration of VOSEVI with rosuvastatin may significantly increase the concentration of rosuvastatin which is associated with increased risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis. Coadministration of VOSEVI with rosuvastatin is not recommended. pitavastatin \u2191 pitavastatin Coadministration with VOSEVI may increase the concentration of pitavastatin and is not recommended, due to an increased risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis. atorvastatin fluvastatin lovastatin simvastatin \u2191 atorvastatin \u2191 fluvastatin \u2191 lovastatin \u2191 simvastatin Coadministration with VOSEVI may increase the concentrations of atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, and simvastatin. Increased statin concentrations may increase the risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis. Use the lowest approved statin dose. If higher doses are needed, use the lowest necessary statin dose based on a risk/benefit assessment. Immunosuppressants: cyclosporine \u2191 voxilaprevir Coadministration of voxilaprevir with cyclosporine has been shown to substantially increase the plasma concentration of voxilaprevir, the safety of which has not been established. Coadministration of VOSEVI with cyclosporine is not recommended. 7.4 Drugs without Clinically Significant Interactions with VOSEVI Based on drug interaction studies conducted with the components of VOSEVI (sofosbuvir, velpatasvir, and/or voxilaprevir) or VOSEVI, no clinically significant drug interactions have been observed with the following drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]: VOSEVI: cobicistat, darunavir, elvitegravir, emtricitabine, ethinyl estradiol/norgestimate, gemfibrozil, rilpivirine, ritonavir, tenofovir alafenamide, voriconazole Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir: dolutegravir, ketoconazole, raltegravir Sofosbuvir: methadone, tacrolimus"

    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in labeling: Serious Symptomatic Bradycardia When Coadministered with Amiodarone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. The most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 10%, all grades) observed with treatment with VOSEVI for 12 weeks were headache, fatigue, diarrhea, and nausea. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Gilead Sciences, Inc. at 1-800-GILEAD-5 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adverse Reactions in HCV-Infected Subjects without Cirrhosis or with Compensated Cirrhosis The adverse reactions data for VOSEVI were derived from two Phase 3 clinical trials (POLARIS-1 and POLARIS-4) that evaluated a total of 445 subjects infected with genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 HCV, without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A), who received VOSEVI for 12 weeks. VOSEVI was studied in placebo- and active-controlled (sofosbuvir/velpatasvir) trials [see Clinical Studies (14.1 and 14.2) ]. The proportion of subjects who permanently discontinued treatment due to adverse events was 0.2% for subjects who received VOSEVI for 12 weeks. The most common adverse reactions (adverse events assessed as causally related by the investigator and at least 10%) were headache, fatigue, diarrhea, and nausea in subjects treated with VOSEVI for 12 weeks. Table 2 lists adverse reactions (adverse events assessed as causally related by the investigator, all grades) observed in at least 5% of subjects receiving 12 weeks of treatment with VOSEVI in the Phase 3 clinical trials. The side-by-side tabulation is to simplify presentation; direct comparison across trials should not be made due to differing trial designs. Table 2 Adverse Reactions (All Grades) Reported in \u22655% of Subjects With HCV Without Cirrhosis or With Compensated Cirrhosis Receiving VOSEVI in POLARIS-1 and POLARIS-4 POLARIS-1 POLARIS-4 VOSEVI 12 weeks (N=263) Placebo 12 weeks (N=152) VOSEVI 12 weeks (N=182) SOF/VEL 12 weeks (N=151) Headache 21% 14% 23% 23% Fatigue 17% 15% 19% 23% Diarrhea 13% 9% 14% 3% Nausea 13% 7% 10% 3% Asthenia 6% 4% 4% 6% Insomnia 6% 3% 3% 1% In POLARIS-1, of the subjects receiving VOSEVI who experienced adverse reactions, 99% were mild or moderate (Grade 1 or 2) in severity. In POLARIS-4, of the subjects receiving VOSEVI who experienced adverse reactions, all the reported adverse reactions were mild or moderate (Grade 1 or 2) in severity. Less Common Adverse Reactions Reported in Clinical Trials The following adverse reactions occurred in less than 5% of subjects without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis treated with VOSEVI for 12 weeks and are included because of a potential causal relationship. Rash: In the POLARIS-1 and POLARIS-4 trials, rash occurred in less than 1% and 2% of subjects treated with VOSEVI, respectively. Rash was reported in 1% of subjects treated with placebo in POLARIS-1 and was not reported by any subject taking sofosbuvir/velpatasvir in POLARIS-4. No serious adverse reactions of rash occurred, and all rashes were mild or moderate in severity. Depression: In the POLARIS-1 and POLARIS-4 trials, depressed mood occurred in less than 1% and 1% of subjects treated with VOSEVI, respectively. Depressed mood was not reported by any subject taking placebo in POLARIS-1 and was reported in 1% of subjects treated with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir in POLARIS-4. No serious adverse reactions of depressed mood occurred and all events were mild or moderate in severity. Laboratory Abnormalities Lipase Elevations: Isolated, asymptomatic lipase elevations of greater than 3\u00d7ULN were observed in POLARIS-1 in 2% of subjects treated with VOSEVI and 3% of subjects treated with placebo, and in POLARIS-4 in 2% of subjects treated with VOSEVI and less than 1% of subjects treated with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir. Creatine Kinase: Isolated, asymptomatic creatine kinase elevations greater than or equal to 10\u00d7ULN were reported in POLARIS-1 in 1% of subjects treated with VOSEVI and 1% of subjects treated with placebo, and in POLARIS-4 in less than 1% of subjects treated with VOSEVI and no subjects treated with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir. Total bilirubin: Increases in total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5\u00d7ULN were observed in subjects treated with VOSEVI due to inhibition of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 by voxilaprevir: 4% and 6% of subjects without cirrhosis in POLARIS-1 and POLARIS-4, respectively; and 7% and 13% of subjects with compensated cirrhosis in POLARIS-1 and POLARIS-4, respectively. No subjects experienced jaundice and total bilirubin levels decreased after completing VOSEVI treatment. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of sofosbuvir-containing regimens. Because postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hepatobiliary Disorders Hepatic decompensation, hepatic failure with NS3/4A protease inhibitor-containing regimens [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Cardiac Disorders Serious symptomatic bradycardia has been reported in patients taking amiodarone who initiated treatment with a sofosbuvir-containing regimen [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Drug Interactions (7.3) ]. Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Skin rashes, sometimes with blisters or angioedema-like swelling Angioedema"
