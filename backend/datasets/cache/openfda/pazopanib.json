    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Avoid coadministration of pazopanib tablets with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. If coadministration cannot be avoided, reduce the dose of pazopanib tablets. ( 2.4 , 7.1 ) Strong CYP3A4 Inducers: Consider an alternate concomitant medication with no or minimal enzyme induction potential. Pazopanib tablets are not recommended if chronic use of strong CYP3A4 inducers cannot be avoided. ( 2.4 , 7.1 ) CYP Substrates: Coadministration of pazopanib tablets with agents with narrow therapeutic windows that are metabolized by CYP3A4, CYP2D6, or CYP2C8 is not recommended. ( 7.2 ) Concomitant Use With Simvastatin: Concomitant use of pazopanib tablets with simvastatin increases the risk of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations. Increase to weekly monitoring of liver function as recommended. Withhold pazopanib tablets and resume at reduced dose, or permanently discontinue based on severity of hepatotoxicity. ( 7.3 ) Concomitant Use With Gastric Acid-Reducing Agents: Avoid concomitant use of pazopanib tablets with gastric acid-reducing agents. Consider short-acting antacids in place of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H2-receptor antagonists. Separate antacid and pazopanib dosing by several hours. ( 2.4 , 7.4 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on Pazopanib Tablets Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Coadministration of pazopanib with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 increases pazopanib concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Avoid coadministration of pazopanib tablets with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and consider an alternate concomitant medication with no or minimal enzyme inhibition potential. If coadministration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor cannot be avoided, reduce the dose of pazopanib tablets [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )]. Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Coadministration of strong CYP3A4 inducers may decrease plasma pazopanib concentrations. Consider an alternate concomitant medication with no or minimal enzyme induction potential. Pazopanib tablets are not recommended if chronic use of strong CYP3A4 inducers cannot be avoided [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )]. Transporters Coadministration of strong inhibitors of P-gp or BCRP may increase pazopanib concentrations. Avoid concomitant use of pazopanib tablets with strong inhibitors of P-gp or BCRP. Consider selection of alternative concomitant medicinal products with no or minimal potential to inhibit P-gp or BCRP. 7.2 Effects of Pazopanib Tablets on Other Drugs CYP Substrates Coadministration of pazopanib tablets with agents with narrow therapeutic windows that are metabolized by CYP3A4, CYP2D6, or CYP2C8 may result in inhibition of the metabolism of these products and create the potential for serious adverse reactions. The concomitant use of pazopanib tablets with agents with narrow therapeutic windows that are metabolized by CYP3A4, CYP2D6, or CYP2C8 is not recommended [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.3 Concomitant Use With Simvastatin Concomitant use of pazopanib tablets with simvastatin increases the incidence of ALT elevations. Across clinical trials of pazopanib tablets as a single agent, ALT > 3 x ULN was reported in 126/895 (14%) of patients who did not use statins compared with 11/41 (27%) of patients who had concomitant use of simvastatin. If a patient receiving concomitant simvastatin develops ALT elevations, increase to weekly monitoring of liver function as recommended. Withhold pazopanib tablets and resume at reduced dose, or permanently discontinue based on severity of hepatotoxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Insufficient data are available to assess the risk of concomitant administration of alternative statins and pazopanib tablets. 7.4 Concomitant Use With Gastric Acid-Reducing Agents Concomitant use of pazopanib tablets with esomeprazole, a PPI, decreased the exposure of pazopanib. Avoid concomitant use of pazopanib tablets with gastric acid-reducing agents. If concomitant administration with a gastric acid-reducing agent cannot be avoided, consider short-acting antacids in place of PPIs and H2-receptor antagonists. Separate short-acting antacid and pazopanib dosing by several hours to avoid a reduction in pazopanib exposure [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.5 Drugs That Prolong the QT Interval Pazopanib is associated with QTc interval prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )]. Avoid coadministration of pazopanib tablets with drugs known to prolong the QT/QTc interval."

The data described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS section reflect exposure of 977 patients who received pazopanib tablets as a single agent, including 586 pazopanib-treated patients with RCC. With a median duration of treatment of 7.4 months (range, 0.1 to 27.6) in these 977 patients, the most common adverse reactions (\u2265 20%) in these 586 patients were diarrhea, hypertension, hair color change, nausea, fatigue, anorexia, and vomiting. The data described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS also reflects exposure of 382 patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma who received pazopanib tablets as a single agent, with a median duration of treatment of 3.6 months (range, 0 to 53). The most common adverse reactions (\u2265 20%) in these 382 patients were fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, decreased weight, hypertension, decreased appetite, vomiting, tumor pain, hair color changes, musculoskeletal pain, headache, dysgeusia, dyspnea, and skin hypopigmentation. Renal Cell Carcinoma The safety of pazopanib tablets was evaluated in 290 patients with RCC who participated in VEG105192, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 ). The median duration of treatment was 7.4 months (range, 0 to 23) for patients who received pazopanib tablets. Forty-two percent of patients on pazopanib tablets required a dose interruption and 36% required a dose reduction. Table 3 presents adverse reactions in VEG105192. Table 3.

Elevated lipase as an adverse reaction was reported for 4% of 225 patients, including 2.7% (6/225) with Grade 3 and 0.4% (1/225) with Grade 4. In the RCC trials, clinical pancreatitis was observed in < 1% of 586 patients. Pneumothorax Two of 290 patients (0.7%) treated with pazopanib tablets in the randomized RCC trial (VEG105192) and 8 of 240 patients (3.3%) treated with pazopanib tablets in the randomized STS trial (VEG110727) developed a pneumothorax. Bradycardia In the randomized RCC trial (VEG105192), bradycardia based on vital signs (< 60 beats per minute) was observed in 19% of 280 patients treated with pazopanib tablets. Bradycardia was reported as an adverse reaction in 2% of 290 patients. In the randomized STS trial (VEG110727), bradycardia based on vital signs (< 60 beats per minute) was observed in 19% of 238 patients treated with pazopanib tablets. Bradycardia was reported as an adverse reaction in 2% of 240 patients. Adverse Reactions in East Asian Patients In an analysis of pooled clinical trial data (N = 1,938) with pazopanib tablets, Grade 3 and Grade 4 neutropenia (12% versus 2%), thrombocytopenia (6% versus < 1%) and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (6% versus 2%) were observed more frequently in patients of East Asian descent than in patients of non-East Asian descent. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of pazopanib tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate the frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

    "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended Dosage: 800 mg orally once daily without food (at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal). ( 2.1 ) Moderate Hepatic Impairment: 200 mg orally once daily. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosage The recommended dosage of pazopanib tablets is 800 mg (four 200 mg tablets) orally once daily without food (at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. The dosage should be modified for hepatic impairment and in patients taking certain concomitant drugs [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 , 2.4 )]. Swallow tablets whole. Do not crush tablets due to the potential for increased rate of absorption, which may affect systemic exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. If a dose is missed, it should not be taken if it is <12 hours until the next dose. 2.2 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions Table 1 summarizes the recommended dose reductions. Table 1. Recommended Dose Reductions of Pazopanib tablets for Adverse Reactions Dose Reduction For Renal Cell Carcinoma For Soft Tissue Sarcoma First 400 mg orally once daily 600 mg orally once daily Second 200 mg orally once daily 400 mg orally once daily Permanently discontinue pazopanib tablets in patients unable to tolerate the second dose reduction. Table 2 summarizes the recommended dosage modifications for adverse reactions. Table 2. Recommended Dosage Modifications of Pazopanib Tablets for Adverse Reactions Adverse Reaction Severity a Dosage Modification Hepatic Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Isolated ALT elevations between 3 x ULN and 8 x ULN Continue and monitor liver function weekly until ALT returns to Grade 1 or baseline. Isolated ALT elevations of > 8 x ULN Withhold until improvement to Grade 1 or baseline. If the potential benefit for resuming treatment with pazopanib tablets is considered to outweigh the risk for hepatotoxicity, then resume at a reduced dose of no more than 400 mg once daily and measure serum liver tests weekly for 8 weeks. Permanently discontinue if ALT elevations > 3 x ULN recur despite dose reduction(s). ALT elevations > 3 x ULN occur concurrently with bilirubin elevations > 2 x ULN Permanently discontinue and continue to monitor until resolution. Patients with only a mild, indirect (unconjugated) hyperbilirubinemia, known as Gilbert's syndrome, and ALT elevations > 3 x ULN should be managed per the recommendations outlined for isolated ALT elevations. Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Symptomatic or Grade 3 Withhold until improvement to Grade < 3. Resume treatment based on medical judgement. Grade 4 Permanently discontinue. Hemorrhagic Events [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Grade 2 Withhold until improvement to Grade \u2264 1. Resume at reduced dose (see Table 1). Permanently discontinue if Grade 2 recurs after dose interruption and reduction. Grade 3 or 4 Permanently discontinue. Arterial Thromboembolic Events [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Any grade Permanently discontinue. Venous Thromboembolic Events [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] Grade 3 Withhold pazopanib tablets and resume at same dose if managed with appropriate therapy for at least one week.

If pazopanib tablets are used in patients with moderate hepatic impairment, reduce the pazopanib tablets dose to 200 mg orally once daily. Pazopanib tablets are not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 3 x ULN and any ALT value) [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )). 2.4 Dosage Modifications for Drug Interactions Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors by use of an alternate concomitant medication with no or minimal potential to inhibit CYP3A4. If coadministration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is warranted, reduce the dose of pazopanib tablets to 400 mg [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers by use of an alternate concomitant medication with no or minimal enzyme induction potential. Pazopanib tablets are not recommended in patients who cannot avoid chronic use of strong CYP3A4 inducers [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. Gastric Acid-Reducing Agents Avoid concomitant use of gastric acid-reducing agents. If concomitant use of a gastric acid-reducing agent cannot be avoided, consider short-acting antacid in place of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H 2 -receptor antagonists. Separate short-acting antacid and pazopanib tablets dosing by several hours [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."
