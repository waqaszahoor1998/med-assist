    "WARNINGS Cardiovascular Disease Cevimeline can potentially alter cardiac conduction and/or heart rate. Patients with significant cardiovascular disease may potentially be unable to compensate for transient changes in hemodynamics or rhythm induced by cevimeline. Cevimeline should be used with caution and under close medical supervision in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease evidenced by angina pectoris or myocardial infarction. Pulmonary Disease Cevimeline can potentially increase airway resistance, bronchial smooth muscle tone, and bronchial secretions. Cevimeline should be administered with caution and with close medical supervision to patients with controlled asthma, chronic bronchitis, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Ocular Ophthalmic formulations of muscarinic agonists have been reported to cause visual blurring which may result in decreased visual acuity, especially at night and in patients with central lens changes, and to cause impairment of depth perception. Caution should be advised while driving at night or performing hazardous activities in reduced lighting."

    "ADVERSE REACTIONS Cevimeline was administered to 1,777 patients during clinical trials worldwide, including Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s patients and patients with other conditions. In placebo-controlled Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s studies in the U.S., 320 patients received cevimeline doses ranging from 15 mg tid to 60 mg tid, of whom 93% were women and 7% were men. Demographic distribution was 90% Caucasian, 5% Hispanic, 3% Black and 2% of other origin. In these studies, 14.6% of patients discontinued treatment with cevimeline due to adverse events. The following adverse events associated with muscarinic agonism were observed in the clinical trials of cevimeline in Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome patients: Adverse Event Cevimeline 30 mg (tid) n n is the total number of patients exposed to the dose at any time during the study. = 533 Placebo (tid) n = 164 Excessive Sweating 18.7% 2.4% Nausea 13.8% 7.9% Rhinitis 11.2% 5.4% Diarrhea 10.3% 10.3% Excessive Salivation 2.2% 0.6% Urinary Frequency 0.9% 1.8% Asthenia 0.5% 0.0% Flushing 0.3% 0.6% Polyuria 0.1% 0.6% In addition, the following adverse events (\u2265 3% incidence) were reported in the Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s clinical trials: Adverse Event Cevimeline 30 mg (tid) n n is the total number of patients exposed to the dose at any time during the study. = 533 Placebo (tid) n = 164 Headache 14.4% 20.1% Sinusitis 12.3% 10.9% Upper Respiratory Tract Infection 11.4% 9.1% Dyspepsia 7.8% 8.5% Abdominal Pain 7.6% 6.7% Urinary Tract Infection 6.1% 3.0% Coughing 6.1% 3.0% Pharyngitis 5.2% 5.4% Vomiting 4.6% 2.4% Injury 4.5% 2.4% Back Pain 4.5% 4.2% Rash 4.3% 6.0% Conjunctivitis 4.3% 3.6% Dizziness 4.1% 7.3% Bronchitis 4.1% 1.2% Arthralgia 3.7% 1.8% Surgical Intervention 3.3% 3.0% Fatigue 3.3% 1.2% Pain 3.3% 3.0% Skeletal Pain 2.8% 1.8% Insomnia 2.4% 1.2% Hot Flushes 2.4% 0.0% Rigors 1.3% 1.2% Anxiety 1.3% 1.2% The following events were reported in Sj\u00f6gren's patients at incidences of < 3% and \u2265 1%: constipation, tremor, abnormal vision, hypertonia, peripheral edema, chest pain, myalgia, fever, anorexia, eye pain, earache, dry mouth, vertigo, salivary gland pain, pruritus, influenza-like symptoms, eye infection, post-operative pain, vaginitis, skin disorder, depression, hiccup, hyporeflexia, infection, fungal infection, sialoadenitis, otitis media, erythematous rash, pneumonia, edema, salivary gland enlargement, allergy, gastroesophageal reflux, eye abnormality, migraine, tooth disorder, epistaxis, flatulence, toothache, ulcerative stomatitis, anemia, hypoesthesia, cystitis, leg cramps, abscess, eructation, moniliasis, palpitation, increased amylase, xerophthalmia, allergic reaction.

The following adverse reaction has been identified during post\u2011approval use of cevimeline. Because post-marketing adverse reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
