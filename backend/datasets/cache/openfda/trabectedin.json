    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS CYP3A inhibitors: Avoid concomitant strong CYP3A inhibitors ( 7.1 ) CYP3A inducers: Avoid concomitant strong CYP3A inducers ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Effect of Cytochrome CYP3A Inhibitors Coadministration of YONDELIS with ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, increased systemic exposure of trabectedin by 66%. Avoid using strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., oral ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, indinavir, lopinavir, ritonavir, boceprevir, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, nefazodone, conivaptan) in patients taking YONDELIS. If a strong CYP3A inhibitor for short-term use (i.e., less than 14 days) must be used, administer the strong CYP3A inhibitor 1 week after the YONDELIS infusion, and discontinue it the day prior to the next YONDELIS infusion [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.2 Effect of Cytochrome CYP3A Inducers Coadministration of YONDELIS with rifampin, a strong CYP3A inducer, decreased systemic exposure of trabectedin by 31%. Avoid using strong CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin, phenobarbital, St. John's wort) in patients taking YONDELIS [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] .",
    "Drug Interactions Effect of Strong CYP3A Inhibitors on Trabectedin Coadministration of multiple doses of ketoconazole (200 mg twice daily for 7.5 days) with a single dose of YONDELIS (0.58 mg/m 2 ) on day 1 increased trabectedin dose-normalized AUC by 66% and C max by 22% compared to a single YONDELIS dose (1.3 mg/m 2 ) given alone. Effect of Strong CYP3A Inducers on Trabectedin Coadministration of multiple doses of rifampin (600 mg daily for 6 days) with a single YONDELIS dose (1.3 mg/m 2 ) on day 6 decreased trabectedin AUC by 31% and C max by 21% compared to a single YONDELIS dose (1.3 mg/m 2 ) given alone. Effect of Trabectedin on CYP Enzymes In vitro , trabectedin has limited inhibition or induction potential of major CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4)."

    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling: Anaphylaxis [see Contraindications (4) ] Neutropenic Sepsis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Rhabdomyolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Cardiomyopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Capillary Leak Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Extravasation Resulting in Tissue Necrosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] The most common (\u226520%) adverse reactions are nausea, fatigue, vomiting, constipation, decreased appetite, diarrhea, peripheral edema, dyspnea, and headache. The most common (\u22655%) grades 3\u20134 laboratory abnormalities are: neutropenia, increased ALT, thrombocytopenia, anemia, increased AST, and increased creatine phosphokinase.

The data described below reflect exposure to YONDELIS in 755 patients with soft tissue sarcoma including 197 (26%) patients exposed to YONDELIS for greater than or equal to 6 months and 57 (8%) patients exposed to YONDELIS for greater than or equal to 1 year. The safety of YONDELIS was evaluated in six open-label, single-arm trials, in which 377 patients received YONDELIS and one open-label, randomized, active-controlled clinical trial in which 378 patients received YONDELIS (Trial ET743-SAR-3007). All patients received YONDELIS at the recommended dosing regimen of 1.5 mg/m 2 administered as an intravenous infusion over 24 hours once every 3 weeks (q3wk, 24-h). The median age was 54 years (range: 18 to 81 years), 63% were female, and all patients had metastatic soft tissue sarcoma. Tables 3 and 4 present selected adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities, respectively, observed in Trial ET743-SAR-3007, an open-label, randomized (2:1), active-controlled trial in which 550 patients with previously treated leiomyosarcoma or liposarcoma (dedifferentiated, myxoid round cell, or pleomorphic) received YONDELIS 1.5 mg/m 2 intravenous infusion over 24 hours once every 3 weeks (n=378) or dacarbazine 1000 mg/m 2 intravenous infusion over 20 to 120 minutes once every 3 weeks (n=172) [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . All patients treated with YONDELIS were required to receive dexamethasone 20 mg intravenous injection 30 minutes prior to start of the YONDELIS infusion. In Trial ET743-SAR-3007, patients had been previously treated with an anthracycline- and ifosfamide-containing regimen or with an anthracycline-containing regimen and one additional cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen. The trial excluded patients with known central nervous system metastasis, elevated serum bilirubin or significant chronic liver disease, such as cirrhosis or active hepatitis, and history of myocardial infarction within 6 months, history of New York Heart Association Class II to IV heart failure, or abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction at baseline. The median age of patients in Trial ET743-SAR-3007 was 57 years (range: 17 to 81 years), with 69% female, 77% White, 12% Black or African American, 4% Asian, and <1% American Indian or Alaska Native. The median duration of exposure to trabectedin was 13 weeks (range: 1 to 127 weeks) with 30% of patients exposed to YONDELIS for greater than 6 months and 7% of patients exposed to YONDELIS for greater than 1 year. In Trial ET743-SAR-3007, adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of YONDELIS occurred in 26% (98/378) of patients; the most common were increased liver tests (defined as ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin) (5.6%), thrombocytopenia (3.4%), fatigue (1.6%), increased creatine phosphokinase (1.1%), and decreased ejection fraction (1.1%). Adverse reactions that led to dose reductions occurred in 42% (158/378) of patients treated with YONDELIS; the most common were increased liver tests (24%), neutropenia (including febrile neutropenia) (8%), thrombocytopenia (4.2%), fatigue (3.7%), increased creatine phosphokinase (2.4%), nausea (1.1%), and vomiting (1.1%). Adverse reactions led to dose interruptions in 52% (198/378) of patients treated with YONDELIS; the most common were neutropenia (31%), thrombocytopenia (15%), increased liver tests (6%), fatigue (2.9%), anemia (2.6%), increased creatinine (1.1%), and nausea (1.1%). The most common adverse reactions (\u226520%) were nausea, fatigue, vomiting, constipation, decreased appetite, diarrhea, peripheral edema, dyspnea, and headache. The most common laboratory abnormalities (\u226520%) were increases in AST or ALT, increased alkaline phosphatase, hypoalbuminemia, increased creatinine, increased creatine phosphokinase, anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia.

Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures. 1 Using aseptic technique, inject 20 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP into the vial. Shake the vial until complete dissolution. The reconstituted solution is clear, colorless to pale brownish-yellow, and contains 0.05 mg/mL of trabectedin. Inspect for particulate matter and discoloration prior to further dilution. Discard vial if particles or discoloration are observed. Immediately following reconstitution, withdraw the calculated volume of trabectedin and further dilute in 500 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride, USP or 5% Dextrose Injection, USP. Do not mix YONDELIS with other drugs. Discard any remaining solution within 30 hours of reconstituting the lyophilized powder. YONDELIS diluted solution is compatible with Type I colorless glass vials, polyvinylchloride (PVC) and polyethylene (PE) bags and tubing, PE and polypropylene (PP) mixture bags, polyethersulfone (PES) in-line filters, titanium, platinum or plastic ports, silicone and polyurethane catheters, and pumps having contact surfaces made of PVC, PE, or PE/PP. 2.5 Administration Infuse the reconstituted, diluted solution over 24 hours through a central venous line using an infusion set with a 0.2 micron polyethersulfone (PES) in-line filter to reduce the risk of exposure to adventitious pathogens that may be introduced during solution preparation. Complete infusion within 30 hours of initial reconstitution. Discard any unused portion of the reconstituted product or of the infusion solution."
