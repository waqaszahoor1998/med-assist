    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 5: Clinically Relevant Interactions with FARXIGA Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues Clinical Impact The risk of hypoglycemia may be increased when FARXIGA is used concomitantly with insulin or insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Intervention Concomitant use may require lower doses of insulin or the insulin secretagogue to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. Lithium Clinical Impact Concomitant use of an SGLT2 inhibitor with lithium may decrease serum lithium concentrations. Intervention Monitor serum lithium concentration more frequently during FARXIGA initiation and dosage changes. Positive Urine Glucose Test Clinical Impact SGLT2 inhibitors increase urinary glucose excretion and will lead to positive urine glucose tests. Intervention Monitoring glycemic control with urine glucose tests is not recommended in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors. Use alternative methods to monitor glycemic control. Interference with 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) Assay Clinical Impact Measurements of 1,5-AG are unreliable in assessing glycemic control in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors. Intervention Monitoring glycemic control with 1,5-AG assay is not recommended. Use alternative methods to monitor glycemic control. See full prescribing information for information on drug interactions and interference of FARXIGA with laboratory tests. (7)",
    "Drug Interactions In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions In in vitro studies, dapagliflozin and dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide neither inhibited CYP 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4, nor induced CYP 1A2, 2B6, or 3A4. Dapagliflozin is a weak substrate of the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) active transporter, and dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide is a substrate for the OAT3 active transporter. Dapagliflozin or dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide did not meaningfully inhibit P-gp, OCT2, OAT1, or OAT3 active transporters. Overall, dapagliflozin is unlikely to affect the pharmacokinetics of concurrently administered medications that are P-gp, OCT2, OAT1, or OAT3 substrates. Effects of Other Drugs on Dapagliflozin Table 6 shows the effect of coadministered drugs on the pharmacokinetics of dapagliflozin. No dose adjustments are recommended for dapagliflozin.

(6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact AstraZeneca at 1-800-236-9933 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. FARXIGA has been evaluated in clinical trials in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, in patients with heart failure, and in patients with chronic kidney disease. The overall safety profile of FARXIGA was consistent across the studied indications. Severe hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) were observed only in patients with diabetes mellitus. Clinical Trials in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Pool of 12 Placebo-Controlled Studies for FARXIGA 5 and 10 mg for Glycemic Control The data in Table 2 is derived from 12 glycemic control placebo-controlled studies in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus ranging from 12 to 24 weeks. In 4 studies FARXIGA was used as monotherapy, and in 8 studies FARXIGA was used as add-on to background antidiabetic therapy or as combination therapy with metformin [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. These data reflect exposure of 2338 patients to FARXIGA with a mean exposure duration of 21 weeks. Patients received placebo (N=1393), FARXIGA 5 mg (N=1145), or FARXIGA 10 mg (N=1193) once daily. The mean age of the population was 55 years and 2% were older than 75 years of age. Fifty percent (50%) of the population were male; 81% were White, 14% were Asian, and 3% were Black or African American. At baseline, the population had diabetes for an average of 6 years, had a mean hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 8.3%, and 21% had established microvascular complications of diabetes. Baseline renal function was normal or mildly impaired in 92% of patients and moderately impaired in 8% of patients (mean eGFR 86 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ). Table 2 shows common adverse reactions associated with the use of FARXIGA. These adverse reactions were not present at baseline, occurred more commonly on FARXIGA than on placebo, and occurred in at least 2% of patients treated with either FARXIGA 5 mg or FARXIGA 10 mg.

(N for males: Placebo=716, FARXIGA 5 mg=564, FARXIGA 10 mg=595). 0.3 2.8 2.7 Nausea 2.4 2.8 2.5 Influenza 2.3 2.7 2.3 Dyslipidemia 1.5 2.1 2.5 Constipation 1.5 2.2 1.9 Discomfort with urination 0.7 1.6 2.1 Pain in extremity 1.4 2.0 1.7 Pool of 13 Placebo-Controlled Studies for FARXIGA 10 mg for Glycemic Control FARXIGA 10 mg was also evaluated in a larger glycemic control placebo-controlled study pool in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. This pool combined 13 placebo-controlled studies, including 3 monotherapy studies, 9 add-on to background antidiabetic therapy studies, and an initial combination with metformin study. Across these 13 studies, 2360 patients were treated once daily with FARXIGA 10 mg for a mean duration of exposure of 22 weeks. The mean age of the population was 59 years and 4% were older than 75 years. Fifty-eight percent (58%) of the population were male; 84% were White, 9% were Asian, and 3% were Black or African American. At baseline, the population had diabetes for an average of 9 years, had a mean HbA1c of 8.2%, and 30% had established microvascular disease. Baseline renal function was normal or mildly impaired in 88% of patients and moderately impaired in 11% of patients (mean eGFR 82 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ). Volume Depletion FARXIGA causes an osmotic diuresis, which may lead to a reduction in intravascular volume. Adverse reactions related to volume depletion (including reports of dehydration, hypovolemia, orthostatic hypotension, or hypotension) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus for the 12-study and 13-study, short-term, placebo-controlled pools and for the DECLARE study are shown in Table 3 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ].

Hypoglycemia was more frequent when FARXIGA was added to sulfonylurea or insulin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Table 4: Incidence of Severe Hypoglycemia Severe episodes of hypoglycemia were defined as episodes of severe impairment in consciousness or behavior, requiring external (third party) assistance, and with prompt recovery after intervention regardless of glucose level. and Hypoglycemia with Glucose < 54 mg/dL Episodes of hypoglycemia with glucose <54 mg/dL (3 mmol/L) were defined as reported episodes of hypoglycemia meeting the glucose criteria that did not also qualify as a severe episode. in Controlled Glycemic Control Clinical Studies in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Placebo/Active Control FARXIGA 5 mg FARXIGA 10 mg Monotherapy (24 weeks) N=75 N=64 N=70 Severe [n (%)] 0 0 0 Glucose <54 mg/dL [n (%)] 0 0 0 Add-on to Metformin (24 weeks) N=137 N=137 N=135 Severe [n (%)] 0 0 0 Glucose <54 mg/dL [n (%)] 0 0 0 Add-on to Glimepiride (24 weeks) N=146 N=145 N=151 Severe [n (%)] 0 0 0 Glucose <54 mg/dL [n (%)] 1 (0.7) 3 (2.1) 5 (3.3) Add-on to Metformin and a Sulfonylurea (24 Weeks) N=109 - N=109 Severe [n (%)] 0 - 0 Glucose <54 mg/dL [n (%)] 3 (2.8) - 7 (6.4) Add-on to Pioglitazone (24 weeks) N=139 N=141 N=140 Severe [n (%)] 0 0 0 Glucose <54 mg/dL [n (%)] 0 1 (0.7) 0 Add-on to DPP4 inhibitor (24 weeks) N=226 \u2013 N=225 Severe [n (%)] 0 \u2013 1 (0.4) Glucose <54 mg/dL [n (%)] 1 (0.4) \u2013 1 (0.4) Add-on to Insulin with or without other OADs OAD = oral antidiabetic therapy.

Genital Mycotic Infections In the glycemic control trials, genital mycotic infections were more frequent with FARXIGA treatment. Genital mycotic infections were reported in 0.9% of patients on placebo, 5.7% on FARXIGA 5 mg, and 4.8% on FARXIGA 10 mg, in the 12-study placebo-controlled pool. Discontinuation from study due to genital infection occurred in 0% of placebo-treated patients and 0.2% of patients treated with FARXIGA 10 mg. Infections were more frequently reported in females than in males (see Table 2). The most frequently reported genital mycotic infections were vulvovaginal mycotic infections in females and balanitis in males. Patients with a history of genital mycotic infections were more likely to have a genital mycotic infection during the study than those with no prior history (10.0%, 23.1%, and 25.0% versus 0.8%, 5.9%, and 5.0% on placebo, FARXIGA 5 mg, and FARXIGA 10 mg, respectively). In the DECLARE study [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] , serious genital mycotic infections were reported in <0.1% of patients treated with FARXIGA and <0.1% of patients treated with placebo. Genital mycotic infections that caused study drug discontinuation were reported in 0.9% of patients treated with FARXIGA and <0.1% of patients treated with placebo. Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., angioedema, urticaria, hypersensitivity) were reported with FARXIGA treatment. In glycemic control studies, serious anaphylactic reactions and severe cutaneous adverse reactions and angioedema were reported in 0.2% of comparator-treated patients and 0.3% of FARXIGA-treated patients. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue use of FARXIGA; treat per standard of care and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve. Ketoacidosis in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus In the DECLARE study [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] , events of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) were reported in 27 out of 8574 patients in the FARXIGA-treated group and 12 out of 8569 patients in the placebo group. The events were evenly distributed over the study period. Laboratory Tests Increases in Serum Creatinine and Decreases in eGFR Initiation of SGLT2 inhibitors, including FARXIGA causes a small increase in serum creatinine and decrease in eGFR. These changes in serum creatinine and eGFR generally occur within two weeks of starting therapy and then stabilize regardless of baseline kidney function. Changes that do not fit this pattern should prompt further evaluation to exclude the possibility of acute kidney injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . In two studies that included patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with moderate renal impairment, the acute effect on eGFR reversed after treatment discontinuation, suggesting acute hemodynamic changes may play a role in the renal function changes observed with FARXIGA. Increase in Hematocrit In the pool of 13 placebo-controlled studies of glycemic control, increases from baseline in mean hematocrit values were observed in FARXIGA-treated patients starting at Week 1 and continuing up to Week 16, when the maximum mean difference from baseline was observed. At Week 24, the mean changes from baseline in hematocrit were \u22120.33% in the placebo group and 2.30% in the FARXIGA 10 mg group. By Week 24, hematocrit values >55% were reported in 0.4% of placebo-treated patients and 1.3% of FARXIGA 10 mg-treated patients. Increase in Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol In the pool of 13 placebo-controlled studies of glycemic control, changes from baseline in mean lipid values were reported in FARXIGA-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. Mean percent changes from baseline at Week 24 were 0.0% versus 2.5% for total cholesterol, and -1.0% versus 2.9% for LDL cholesterol in the placebo and FARXIGA 10 mg groups, respectively. In the DECLARE study [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] , mean changes from baseline after 4 years were 0.4 mg/dL versus -4.1 mg/dL for total cholesterol, and -2.5 mg/dL versus -4.4 mg/dL for LDL cholesterol, in FARXIGA-treated and the placebo groups, respectively. Decrease in Serum Bicarbonate In a study of concomitant therapy of FARXIGA 10 mg with exenatide extended-release (on a background of metformin), four patients (1.7%) on concomitant therapy had a serum bicarbonate value of less than or equal to 13 mEq/L compared to one each (0.4%) in the FARXIGA and exenatide-extended release treatment groups [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . DAPA-HF and DELIVER Heart Failure Studies No new adverse reactions were identified in the DAPA-HF and DELIVER heart failure studies. DAPA-CKD Chronic Kidney Disease Study No new adverse reactions were identified in the DAPA-CKD study in patients with chronic kidney disease. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of FARXIGA in patients with diabetes mellitus. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
