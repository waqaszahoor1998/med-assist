    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling: Risk of Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Increased Exposure in Patients with Hepatic Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Injection Site Reaction [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Embryo-Fetal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] The most common adverse reactions occurring in \u22655% of patients receiving Fulvestrant Injection 500 mg were: injection site pain, nausea, bone pain, arthralgia, headache, back pain, fatigue, pain in extremity, hot flash, vomiting, anorexia, asthenia, musculoskeletal pain, cough, dyspnea, and constipation. ( 6.1 ) Increased hepatic enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP) occurred in >15% of Fulvestrant Injection patients and were not dose-dependent. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Meitheal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-844-824-8426 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed cannot be directly compared to rates in other trials and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Monotherapy Comparison of Fulvestrant Injection 500 mg and Fulvestrant Injection 250 mg (CONFIRM) The following adverse reactions (ARs) were calculated based on the safety analysis of CONFIRM comparing the administration of Fulvestrant Injection 500 mg intramuscularly once a month with Fulvestrant Injection 250 mg intramuscularly once a month. The most frequently reported adverse reactions in the Fulvestrant Injection 500 mg group were injection site pain (11.6% of patients), nausea (9.7% of patients), and bone pain (9.4% of patients); the most frequently reported adverse reactions in the Fulvestrant Injection 250 mg group were nausea (13.6% of patients), back pain (10.7% of patients), and injection site pain (9.1% of patients). Table 1 lists adverse reactions reported with an incidence of 5% or greater, regardless of assessed causality, from CONFIRM. Table 1: Adverse Reactions in CONFIRM (\u22655% in Either Treatment Group) 1 Including more severe injection site related sciatica, neuralgia, neuropathic pain, and peripheral neuropathy.

Grade 3-4 increases were observed in 1-2% of patients. The incidence and severity of increased hepatic enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP) did not differ between the 250 mg and the 500 mg Fulvestrant Injection arms. Comparison of Fulvestrant Injection 500 mg and Anastrozole 1 mg (FALCON) The safety of Fulvestrant Injection 500 mg versus anastrozole 1 mg was evaluated in FALCON. The data described below reflect exposure to Fulvestrant Injection in 228 out of 460 patients with HR-positive advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women not previously treated with endocrine therapy who received at least one (1) dose of treatment in FALCON. Permanent discontinuation associated with an adverse reaction occurred in 4 of 228 (1.8%) patients receiving Fulvestrant Injection, and in 3 of 232 (1.3%) patients receiving anastrozole. Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation for those patients receiving Fulvestrant Injection included drug hypersensitivity (0.9%), injection site hypersensitivity (0.4%), and elevated liver enzymes (0.4%). The most common adverse reactions (\u226510%) of any grade reported in patients in the Fulvestrant Injection arm were arthralgia, hot flash, fatigue and nausea. Adverse reactions reported in patients who received Fulvestrant Injection in FALCON at an incidence of \u22655% in either treatment arm are listed in Table 2 , and laboratory abnormalities are listed in Table 3 .

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. For Fulvestrant Injection 250 mg, other adverse reactions reported as drug-related and seen infrequently (<1%) include thromboembolic phenomena, myalgia, vertigo, leukopenia, and hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema and urticaria. Vaginal bleeding has been reported infrequently (<1%), mainly in patients during the first 6 weeks after changing from existing hormonal therapy to treatment with Fulvestrant Injection. If bleeding persists, further evaluation should be considered. Elevation of bilirubin, elevation of gamma GT, hepatitis, and liver failure have been reported infrequently (<1%)."

Refer to the Full Prescribing Information of co-administered palbociclib, abemaciclib, or ribociclib for dose modification guidelines in the event of toxicities, for use with concomitant medications, and other relevant safety information. 2.3 Administration Technique Administer the injection according to the local guidelines for performing large volume intramuscular injections. NOTE: Due to the proximity of the underlying sciatic nerve, caution should be taken if administering Fulvestrant Injection at the dorsogluteal injection site [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . The proper method of administration of Fulvestrant Injection for intramuscular use is described in the following instructions. For each single-dose prefilled syringe: Remove glass syringe barrel from tray and check that it is not damaged. Remove perforated patient record label from syringe. Inspect drug product in glass syringe for any visible particulate matter or discoloration prior to use. Discard if particulate matter or discoloration is present. Peel open the safety needle (SafetyGlide \u2122 ) outer packaging. Hold the syringe upright on the ribbed part (C). With the other hand, take hold of the cap (A) and carefully TWIST THE CAP in a counter-clockwise direction until the cap disconnects for removal (see Figure 1 ). Figure 1 Pull the cap (A) off in a straight upward direction. DO NOT TOUCH THE STERILE SYRINGE TIP (Luer-Lok) (B) (see Figure 2 ). Figure 2 Attach the safety needle to the syringe tip (Luer-Lok). Twist needle until firmly seated (see Figure 3 ). Confirm that the needle is locked to the Luer connector before moving or tilting the syringe out of the vertical plane to avoid spillage of syringe contents. Figure 3 For Administration: Pull shield straight off needle to avoid damaging needle point. Remove needle sheath. Expel excess gas from the syringe (a small gas bubble may remain). Administer intramuscularly slowly (1-2 minutes/injection) into the buttock (gluteal area). For user convenience, the needle \u2018bevel up\u2019 position is orientated to the lever arm, as shown in Figure 4 . Figure 4 After injection, immediately activate the lever arm to deploy the needle shielding by applying a single-finger stroke to the activation assisted lever arm to push the lever arm completely forward. Listen for a click. Confirm that the needle shielding has completely covered the needle (see Figure 5 ). NOTE: Activate away from self and others. Figure 5 Discard the empty syringe into an approved sharps collector in accordance with applicable regulations and institutional policy. Repeat steps 1 through 13 for second syringe. How To Use Fulvestrant Injection For the 2 x 5 mL syringe package, the contents of both syringes must be injected to receive the 500 mg recommended dose.
