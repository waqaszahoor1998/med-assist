    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Diarrhea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Bullous and Exfoliative Skin Disorders [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Interstitial Lung Disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Hepatic Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Gastrointestinal Perforation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Keratitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Most common adverse reactions (\u226520%) were diarrhea, rash/acneiform dermatitis, stomatitis, paronychia, dry skin, decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, pruritus ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at (800) 542-6257 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data in the Warnings and Precautions section reflect exposure to GILOTRIF for clinically significant adverse reactions in 4257 patients enrolled in LUX-Lung 3 (n=229) and LUX-Lung 8 (n=392), and 3636 patients with cancer enrolled in 42 studies of GILOTRIF administered alone or in combination with other anti-neoplastic drugs at GILOTRIF doses ranging from 10-70 mg daily or at doses 10-160 mg in other regimens. The mean exposure was 5.5 months. The population included patients with various cancers, the most common of which were NSCLC, breast, colorectal, brain, and head and neck. The data described below reflect exposure to GILOTRIF as a single agent in LUX-Lung 3, a randomized, active-controlled trial conducted in patients with EGFR mutation-positive, metastatic NSCLC, and in LUX-Lung 8, a randomized, active-controlled trial in patients with metastatic squamous NSCLC progressing after platinum-based chemotherapy. EGFR Mutation-Positive Metastatic NSCLC The safety of GILOTRIF was evaluated in 229 EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor-na\u00efve patients with EGFR mutation-positive, metastatic non-squamous NSCLC enrolled in a randomized (2:1), multicenter, open-label trial (LUX-Lung 3). Patients received either GILOTRIF 40 mg daily until documented disease progression or intolerance to the therapy or pemetrexed 500 mg/m\u00b2 followed after 30 minutes by cisplatin 75 mg/m\u00b2 every three weeks for a maximum of six treatment courses. The median exposure was 11 months for patients treated with GILOTRIF and 3.4 months for patients treated with pemetrexed/cisplatin. The overall trial population had a median age of 61 years; 61% of patients in the GILOTRIF arm and 60% of patients in the pemetrexed/cisplatin arm were younger than 65 years. A total of 64% of patients on GILOTRIF and 67% of pemetrexed/cisplatin patients were female. More than two-thirds of patients were from Asia (GILOTRIF 70%; pemetrexed/cisplatin 72%). Serious adverse reactions were reported in 29% of patients treated with GILOTRIF. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in patients treated with GILOTRIF were diarrhea (6.6%); vomiting (4.8%); and dyspnea, fatigue, and hypokalemia (1.7% each). Fatal adverse reactions in GILOTRIF-treated patients in LUX-Lung 3 included pulmonary toxicity/ILD-like adverse reactions (1.3%), sepsis (0.43%), and pneumonia (0.43%). Dose reductions due to adverse reactions were required in 57% of GILOTRIF-treated patients. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to dose reduction in the patients treated with GILOTRIF were diarrhea (20%), rash/acne (19%), paronychia (14%), and stomatitis (10%). Discontinuation of therapy in GILOTRIF-treated patients for adverse reactions was 14.0%. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to discontinuation in GILOTRIF-treated patients were diarrhea (1.3%), ILD (0.9%), and paronychia (0.9%). Clinical trials of GILOTRIF excluded patients with an abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), i.e., below the institutional lower limit of normal. In LUX-Lung 3, all patients were evaluated for LVEF at screening and every 9 weeks thereafter in the GILOTRIF-treated group and as needed in the pemetrexed/cisplatin group. More GILOTRIF-treated patients (2.2%; n=5) experienced ventricular dysfunction (defined as diastolic dysfunction, left ventricular dysfunction, or ventricular dilation; all <Grade 3) compared to chemotherapy-treated patients (0.9%; n=1). Tables 1 and 2 summarize common adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities in LUX-Lung 3.

Patients were required to have received at least four cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy, ECOG Performance Status (PS) 0 or 1, and normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Patients received GILOTRIF 40 mg once daily (n=392) or erlotinib 150 mg once daily (n=395). Treatment continued until documented disease progression or intolerance to the therapy. The median exposure was 2.1 months for patients treated with GILOTRIF, 15% were exposed for at least 6 months, and 5% were exposed for at least 12 months. Among the 392 GILOTRIF-treated patients, the median age was 65 years, 53% were 65 years of age or older, 84% were male, 72% were White, 25% were Asian, ECOG PS 0 (32%) or 1 (68%). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 44% of patients treated with GILOTRIF. The most frequent serious adverse reactions in patients treated with GILOTRIF were pneumonia (6.6%), diarrhea (4.6%), and dehydration and dyspnea (3.1% each). Fatal adverse reactions in GILOTRIF-treated patients included ILD (0.5%), pneumonia (0.3%), respiratory failure (0.3%), acute renal failure (0.3%), and general physical health deterioration (0.3%). The most frequent adverse reactions that led to discontinuation in GILOTRIF-treated patients were diarrhea (4.1%) and rash/acne (2.6%). Dose reductions due to adverse reactions were required in 27% of GILOTRIF-treated patients and discontinuation of GILOTRIF for adverse reactions was required for 20%. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to dose reduction in the patients treated with GILOTRIF were diarrhea (15%), rash/acne (5.9%), and stomatitis (3.1%).

Less Common Adverse Reactions Other adverse reactions reported in patients treated with GILOTRIF in LUX-Lung 3 and LUX-Lung 8 include: Skin and subcutaneous disorders: nail disorders occurred in 9.2% and 2.8% of patients, respectively. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of GILOTRIF. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
