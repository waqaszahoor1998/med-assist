    "2.3 Dosage Modifications for Use with Strong and Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Avoid coadministration of ZEPZELCA with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors. If coadministration of ZEPZELCA with a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor cannot be avoided, reduce the dose of ZEPZELCA by 50% [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . After discontinuation of a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor for 5 half-lives of the inhibitor, increase the ZEPZELCA dose to the dose used before starting the inhibitor .",
    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022 Effect of Other Drugs on ZEPZELCA : Avoid coadministration. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on ZEPZELCA Strong and Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Coadministration of ZEPZELCA with a strong or a moderate CYP3A inhibitor increases lurbinectedin systemic exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ], which may increase the incidence and severity of adverse reactions to ZEPZELCA. Avoid grapefruit and Seville oranges during ZEPZELCA treatment, as these contain strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP3A. Avoid coadministration of ZEPZELCA with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors. If coadministration cannot be avoided, reduce the dose of ZEPZELCA [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Strong CYP3A Inducers Avoid coadministration of ZEPZELCA with strong CYP3A inducers. Coadministration of ZEPZELCA with a strong CYP3A inducer may decrease lurbinectedin systemic exposure, which may decrease the efficacy of ZEPZELCA [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-800-520-5568 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to ZEPZELCA as a single agent at a dose of 3.2 mg/m 2 intravenously every 21 days in 554 patients with advanced solid tumors. Among 554 patients who received ZEPZELCA, including 105 patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) in PM1183-B-005-14 (Study B-005), 24% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 5% were exposed for greater than one year. Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) The safety of ZEPZELCA was evaluated in a cohort of 105 patients with previously treated SCLC in Study B-005 [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Patients received ZEPZELCA 3.2 mg/m 2 intravenously every 21 days. All patients in this study received a pre-specified anti-emetic regimen consisting of a corticosteroid and serotonin antagonist. Patients could receive G-CSF for secondary prophylaxis (i.e., after patients had an initial decrease in WBC), but not primary prophylaxis. Among patients who received ZEPZELCA, 29% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 6% were exposed for greater than one year. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 34% of patients who received ZEPZELCA. Serious adverse reactions in \u2265 3% of patients included pneumonia, febrile neutropenia, neutropenia, respiratory tract infection, anemia, dyspnea, and thrombocytopenia. Permanent discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in two patients (1.9%) who received ZEPZELCA. Adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation in \u2265 1% of patients who received ZEPZELCA, which included peripheral neuropathy and myelosuppression. Dosage interruptions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 30.5% of patients who received ZEPZELCA. Adverse reactions requiring dosage interruption in \u2265 3% of patients who received ZEPZELCA included neutropenia, and hypoalbuminemia. Dose reductions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 25% of patients who received ZEPZELCA. Adverse reactions requiring dosage reductions in \u2265 3% of patients who received ZEPZELCA included neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and fatigue. The most common adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, (\u2265 20%) were leukopenia, lymphopenia, fatigue, anemia, neutropenia, increased creatinine, increased alanine aminotransferase, increased glucose, thrombocytopenia, nausea, decreased appetite, musculoskeletal pain, decreased albumin, constipation, dyspnea, decreased sodium, increased aspartate aminotransferase, vomiting, cough, decreased magnesium and diarrhea. Table 3 summarizes the adverse reactions in the SCLC cohort of Study B-005.

If coadministration of ZEPZELCA with a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor cannot be avoided, reduce the dose of ZEPZELCA by 50% [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . After discontinuation of a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor for 5 half-lives of the inhibitor, increase the ZEPZELCA dose to the dose used before starting the inhibitor . 2.4 Dosage Modifications for Patients with Severe and Moderate Hepatic Impairment Avoid administration of ZEPZELCA in patients with severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 3 \u00d7 Upper Limit of Normal (ULN)). If administration of ZEPZELCA cannot be avoided, the recommended dosage is 1.6 mg/m 2 by intravenous infusion over 60 minutes every 21 days until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 1.5 to \u2264 3 \u00d7 ULN and any AST), the recommended dosage of ZEPZELCA is 1.6 mg/m 2 by intravenous infusion over 60 minutes every 21 days until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 2.5 Premedication Consider administering the following pre-infusion medications for antiemetic prophylaxis [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] : \u2022 Corticosteroids (dexamethasone 8 mg intravenously or equivalent) \u2022 Serotonin antagonists (ondansetron 8 mg intravenously or equivalent) 2.6 Preparation, Administration and Storage ZEPZELCA is a hazardous drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures 1 . Preparation \u2022 Inject 8 mL of Sterile Water for Injection USP into the vial, yielding a solution containing 0.5 mg/mL lurbinectedin. Shake the vial until complete dissolution. \u2022 Visually inspect the solution for particulate matter and discoloration. The reconstituted solution is a clear, colorless or slightly yellowish solution, essentially free of visible particles. \u2022 Calculate the required volume of reconstituted solution as follows: \u2022 For administration through a central venous line, withdraw the appropriate amount of reconstituted solution from the vial and add to an infusion container containing at least 100 mL of diluent (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection USP or 5% Dextrose Injection USP). \u2022 For administration through a peripheral venous line, withdraw the appropriate amount of reconstituted solution from the vial and add to an infusion container containing at least 250 mL of diluent (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection USP or 5% Dextrose Injection USP). Administration \u2022 Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. If particulate matter is observed, do not administer. \u2022 ZEPZELCA can be administered with or without an in-line filter. If infusion lines containing in-line filters are utilized for administration of ZEPZELCA, polyethersulfone (PES) in-line filters with pore sizes of 0.22 micron are recommended. o Do not use in-line nylon membrane filters when the reconstituted ZEPZELCA solution is diluted using 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. Adsorption of ZEPZELCA to the Nylon membrane filters has been observed when 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP is used as the diluent. \u2022 Compatibility with other intravenous administration materials and the diluted ZEPZELCA solution has been demonstrated in the following materials: o Polyolefin containers (polyethylene, polypropylene and mixtures). o Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) (non-DEHP-containing), polyurethane and polyolefin infusion sets (polyethylene, polypropylene and polybutadiene). o Implantable venous access systems with titanium and plastic resin ports and with polyurethane or silicone intravenous catheters. \u2022 Do not co-administer ZEPZELCA and other intravenous drugs concurrently within the same intravenous line. Storage of Infusion Solution \u2022 If not used immediately after reconstitution or dilution, the ZEPZELCA solution can be stored prior to administration for up to 24 hours following reconstitution, including infusion time, at either room temperature/ ambient light or under refrigeration at 2\u00baC to 8\u00baC (36\u00baF to 46\u00baF) conditions. volume calculation"
