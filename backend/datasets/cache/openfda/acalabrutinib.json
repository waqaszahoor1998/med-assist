( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact AstraZeneca at 1-800-236-9933 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data in the Warnings and Precautions reflect exposure to CALQUENCE 100 mg approximately every 12 hours in 1,764 patients with hematologic malignancies. Treatment includes CALQUENCE monotherapy in 1,256 patients in 9 trials, and CALQUENCE combinations in 508 patients in 3 trials. Among these recipients of CALQUENCE, 88% were exposed for at least 6 months and 80% were exposed for at least one year. In this pooled safety population, adverse reactions in \u2265 30% of 1,764 patients, excluding laboratory abnormalities, were diarrhea (37%), upper respiratory tract infection (36%), headache (35%), musculoskeletal pain (33%), lower respiratory tract infection (32%), and fatigue (32%). The most common grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities (\u226510%) were absolute neutrophil count decreased (31%), absolute lymphocyte count decreased (23%), platelets decreased (11%), and hemoglobin decreased (10%). Previously Untreated Mantle Cell Lymphoma The safety data described below reflect exposure to CALQUENCE (100 mg approximately every 12 hours, with or without BR) in patients with MCL [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . ECHO The safety of CALQUENCE in combination with bendamustine and rituximab (CALQUENCE plus BR) was evaluated in 297 patients with previously untreated MCL in ECHO [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . The trial enrolled patients with previously untreated MCL, \u2265 65 years of age with no intention for transplant, total bilirubin \u2264 1.5 \u00d7 ULN, AST or ALT \u2264 2.5 \u00d7 ULN, and estimated creatinine clearance of > 50 mL/min. Patients received 6 cycles (as 28-day cycles) of CALQUENCE 100 mg orally twice daily (n = 297) or placebo (n = 297) in combination with bendamustine and rituximab. Patients then received CALQUENCE 100 mg orally twice daily or placebo continuously until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity, with 12 additional dosages of rituximab every other cycle up to Cycle 30. The median duration of treatment with CALQUENCE was 28.6 months. A total of 171 (57.6%) patients were treated with CALQUENCE for \u02c3 24 months and 122 (41.1%) patients were treated for \u02c3 36 months. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 69% of patients who received CALQUENCE plus BR. Serious adverse reactions reported in \u2265 2% of patients were pneumonia (23%; includes COVID-19 pneumonia), COVID-19 (20%; includes COVID-19 pneumonia), pyrexia (6%), second primary malignancy (7%), rash (3.4%), febrile neutropenia (3.4%), atrial fibrillation (3%), sepsis (2.7%), and anemia (2.4%). Fatal adverse reactions that occurred within 30 days of the last study treatment were reported in 12% who received CALQUENCE plus BR including COVID-19 (6%; includes COVID-19 pneumonia), pneumonia (1%), sepsis (0.3%), second primary malignancy (0.7%), and pneumonitis (0.3%). Adverse reactions led to permanent discontinuation of CALQUENCE in 43%, dosage interruptions in 74%, and dosage reductions in 10% of patients. Adverse reactions that resulted in dosage modification in > 10% included infections, cytopenias, rashes, and gastrointestinal toxicity. Adverse reactions which resulted in permanent discontinuation of CALQUENCE in \u2265 4% of patients included COVID-19 (includes COVID-19 pneumonia) and neutropenia.

Increases in creatinine to 1.5 to 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) occurred in 4.8% of patients. Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia The safety data described below reflect exposure to CALQUENCE (100 mg approximately every 12 hours, with or without obinutuzumab) in 511 patients with CLL from two randomized controlled clinical trials [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] . The most common adverse reactions (\u2265 30%) of any grade in patients with CLL were anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, headache, upper respiratory tract infection, and diarrhea. ELEVATE-TN The safety of CALQUENCE plus obinutuzumab (CALQUENCE+G), CALQUENCE monotherapy, and obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil (GClb) was evaluated in a randomized, multicenter, open-label, actively controlled trial in 526 patients with previously untreated CLL [see Clinical Studies (14.3)] . Patients randomized to the CALQUENCE+G arm were treated with CALQUENCE and obinutuzumab in combination for six cycles, then with CALQUENCE as monotherapy until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients initiated obinutuzumab on Day 1 of Cycle 2, continuing for a total of 6 cycles. Patient randomized to CALQUENCE monotherapy received CALQUENCE approximately every 12 hours until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The trial required age \u2265 65 years of age or 18 to < 65 years of age with a total Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS) > 6 or creatinine clearance of 30 to 69 mL/min, hepatic transaminases \u2264 3 times ULN and total bilirubin \u2264 1.5 times ULN, and allowed patients to receive antithrombotic agents other than warfarin or equivalent vitamin K antagonists. During randomized treatment, the median duration of exposure to CALQUENCE in the CALQUENCE+G and CALQUENCE monotherapy arms was 27.7 months (range 0.3 to 40 months), with 95% and 92% and 89% and 86% of patients with at least 6 months and 12 months of exposure, respectively. In the obinutuzumab and chlorambucil arm the median number of cycles was 6 with 84% of patients receiving at least 6 cycles of obinutuzumab, 70% of patients received at least 6 cycles of chlorambucil. Eighty-five percent of patients in the CALQUENCE+G arm received at least 6 cycles of obinutuzumab. In the CALQUENCE+G and CALQUENCE monotherapy arms, fatal adverse reactions that occurred in the absence of disease progression and with onset within 30 days of the last study treatment were reported in 2% for each treatment arm, most often from infection. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 39% of patients in the CALQUENCE+G arm and 32% in the CALQUENCE monotherapy arm, most often due to events of pneumonia (2.8% to 7%). In the CALQUENCE+G arm, adverse reactions led to treatment discontinuation in 11% of patients and a dose reduction of CALQUENCE in 7% of patients. In the CALQUENCE monotherapy arm, adverse reactions led to discontinuation in 10% and dose reduction in 4% of patients. Tables 8 and 9 present adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities identified in the ELEVATE-TN trial.

ASCEND The safety of CALQUENCE in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL was evaluated in a randomized, open-label study (ASCEND) [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] . The trial enrolled patients with relapsed or refractory CLL after at least one prior therapy and required hepatic transaminases \u2264 2 times ULN, total bilirubin \u2264 1.5 times ULN, and an estimated creatinine clearance \u2265 30 mL/min. The trial excluded patients having an absolute neutrophil count < 500/\u00b5L, platelet count < 30,000/\u00b5L, prothrombin time or activated partial thromboplastin time > 2 times ULN, significant cardiovascular disease, or a requirement for strong CYP3A inhibitors or inducers. Patients were allowed to receive antithrombotic agents other than warfarin or equivalent vitamin K antagonist. In ASCEND, 154 patients received CALQUENCE (100 mg approximately every 12 hours until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity), 118 received idelalisib (150 mg approximately every 12 hours until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity) with up to 8 infusions of a rituximab product, and 35 received up to 6 cycles of bendamustine and a rituximab product. The median age overall was 68 years (range: 32-90); 67% were male; 92% were white; and 88% had an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. In the CALQUENCE arm, serious adverse reactions occurred in 29% of patients. Serious adverse reactions in > 5% of patients who received CALQUENCE included lower respiratory tract infection (6%). Fatal adverse reactions within 30 days of the last dose of CALQUENCE occurred in 2.6% of patients, including from second primary malignancies and infection. In recipients of CALQUENCE, permanent discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 10% of patients, most frequently due to second primary malignancies followed by infection. Adverse reactions led to dosage interruptions of CALQUENCE in 34% of patients, most often due to respiratory tract infections followed by neutropenia, and dose reduction in 3.9% of patients. Selected adverse reactions are described in Table 10 and non-hematologic laboratory abnormalities are described in Table 11. These tables reflect exposure to CALQUENCE with median duration of 15.7 months with 94% of patients on treatment for greater than 6 months and 86% of patients on treatment for greater than 12 months. The median duration of exposure to idelalisib was 11.5 months with 72% of patients on treatment for greater than 6 months and 48% of patients on treatment for greater than 12 months. Eighty-three percent of patients completed 6 cycles of bendamustine and rituximab product.

Once toxicity has resolved to Grade 1 or baseline level, CALQUENCE may be resumed at 100 mg approximately every 12 hours. Third Interrupt CALQUENCE. Once toxicity has resolved to Grade 1 or baseline level, CALQUENCE may be resumed at a reduced frequency of 100 mg once daily. Fourth Discontinue CALQUENCE. Adverse reactions graded by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE). Table 3: Recommended Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions in Patients Receiving CALQUENCE in Combination with BR Adverse Reaction Severitya Dosage Modification (Starting dosage of CALQUENCE = 100 mg approximately every 12 hours) Neutropenia b [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Absolute neutrophil count less than 0.5 x 109/L for greater than 7 days Interrupt CALQUENCE. Once toxicity has resolved to Grade \u2264 2, resume CALQUENCE at starting dosage. Upon 2 nd or 3 rd occurrence, reduce dosage of CALQUENCE to 100 mg once daily. c Discontinue CALQUENCE at 4 th occurrence. For bendamustine b : Interrupt bendamustine. Once toxicity has resolved to Grade \u2264 2, resume bendamustine and consider dosage reduction to 70 mg/m 2 . d,e Thrombocytopenia f [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Platelet count 25 to 50 x 109/L with clinically significant bleeding or platelet count less than 25 x 109/L Interrupt CALQUENCE. Once toxicity has resolved to Grade \u2264 2 or baseline, resume CALQUENCE at starting dosage. If recurrence, reduce dosage of CALQUENCE to 100 mg once daily. c Consider discontinuing CALQUENCE at 3 rd occurrence. For bendamustine f : Interrupt bendamustine. Once toxicity has resolved to Grade \u2264 2 or baseline, resume bendamustine and consider dose reduction to 70 mg/m 2 . e Non\u2011hematologic adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5)] Grade 3 or higher Interrupt CALQUENCE. Once toxicity has resolved to Grade \u2264 2 or baseline, resume CALQUENCE at starting dosage. If recurrence, reduce dosage of CALQUENCE to 100 mg once daily. c Discontinue CALQUENCE at 3 rd occurrence of Grade 4 toxicity. For Grade 3 toxicity, consider the risks and benefits of continuing CALQUENCE. For bendamustine : Interrupt bendamustine. Once toxicity has resolved to Grade \u2264 2 or baseline, resume bendamustine and consider dose reduction to 70 mg/m 2 . e a Graded per National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.03. b For neutropenia with ANC less than 1 x 109/L, consideration for bendamustine dose interruption and dosage reduction to 70 mg/m2 may be appropriate in certain circumstances. c Dose may be re-escalated at the discretion of the physician if patient tolerates a reduced dose for \u22654 weeks. d Consider use of myeloid growth factors before bendamustine dosage reduction. e Consider discontinuing bendamustine if additional dosage reduction is required. f For thrombocytopenia, a platelet count below 50 x 109/L should prompt bendamustine dose interruption even in the absence of clinically significant bleeding .
