    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong CYP3A Inducers : Avoid concomitant use. If not possible, increase TAGRISSO to 160 mg daily in patients receiving a strong CYP3A4 inducer. ( 2.5 , 7.1 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on Osimertinib Strong CYP3A Inducers Co-administering TAGRISSO with a strong CYP3A4 inducer decreased the exposure of osimertinib compared to administering TAGRISSO alone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Decreased osimertinib exposure may lead to reduced efficacy. Avoid co-administering TAGRISSO with strong CYP3A inducers. Increase the TAGRISSO dosage when co-administering with a strong CYP3A4 inducer if concurrent use is unavoidable [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . No dose adjustments are required when TAGRISSO is used with moderate and/or weak CYP3A inducers. 7.2 Effect of Osimertinib on Other Drugs Co-administering TAGRISSO with a breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP) or P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate increased the exposure of the substrate compared to administering it alone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Increased BCRP or P-gp substrate exposure may increase the risk of exposure-related toxicity. Monitor for adverse reactions of the BCRP or P-gp substrate, unless otherwise instructed in its approved labeling, when co-administered with TAGRISSO. 7.3 Drugs That Prolong the QTc Interval The effect of co-administering medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval with TAGRISSO is unknown. When feasible, avoid concomitant administration of drugs known to prolong the QTc interval with known risk of Torsades de pointes. If not feasible to avoid concomitant administration of such drugs, conduct periodic ECG monitoring [see Error! Hyperlink reference not valid. and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]."

The data in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS section reflect exposure to TAGRISSO in 1813 patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC who received TAGRISSO monotherapy at the recommended dose of 80 mg orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity in four randomized, controlled trials [ADAURA (n=337), FLAURA (n=338), FLAURA2 (monotherapy arm; n=275), and AURA3 (n=279)] [see Clinical Studies (14) ] , two single arm trials [AURA Extension (n=201) {NCT01802632} and AURA2 (n=210)]{NCT02094261}, and one dose-finding study, AURA1 (n=173). Among 1813 patients who received TAGRISSO monotherapy, 82% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 67% were exposed for greater than one year. In this pooled safety population, the most common adverse reactions in \u226520% of 1813 patients who received TAGRISSO monotherapy were diarrhea (47%), rash (46%), musculoskeletal pain (38%), nail toxicity (34%), dry skin (32%), stomatitis (24%), and fatigue (21%). The most common laboratory abnormalities in \u226520% of 1813 patients who received TAGRISSO monotherapy were leukopenia (65%), lymphopenia (64%), thrombocytopenia (53%), anemia (52%), and neutropenia (36%). In addition to the 1813 patients, certain subsections in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS describe adverse reactions observed with exposure to TAGRISSO monotherapy (80 mg orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity) following definitive platinum-based chemoradiation therapy (n=143) in the LAURA study. The data described below reflect exposure to TAGRISSO (80 mg daily) in 337 patients with EGFR mutation-positive resectable NSCLC, 143 patients with EGFR mutation-positive locally advanced, unresectable (stage III) NSCLC, and 833 patients with EGFR mutation-positive locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC in five randomized, controlled trials [ADAURA (n=337), LAURA (n=143), FLAURA (n=279), FLAURA2 (monotherapy arm; n=275), and AURA3 (n=279)]. The data also reflect exposure to TAGRISSO at the recommended dose of 80 mg daily given in combination with pemetrexed and platinum-based chemotherapy in 276 patients with EGFR mutation-positive locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC in one randomized controlled trial [FLAURA2 (n=276)]. Patients with a history of interstitial lung disease, drug induced interstitial disease or radiation pneumonitis that required steroid treatment, serious arrhythmia or baseline QTc interval greater than 470 msec on electrocardiogram were excluded from enrollment in these studies. Adjuvant Treatment of EGFR Mutation-Positive NSCLC - Monotherapy The safety of TAGRISSO was evaluated in ADAURA, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial for the adjuvant treatment of patients with EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R mutation-positive NSCLC who had complete tumor resection, with or without prior adjuvant chemotherapy. At time of DFS analysis, the median duration of exposure to TAGRISSO was 22.5 months. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 16% of patients treated with TAGRISSO. The most common serious adverse reaction (\u22651%) was pneumonia (1.5%). Adverse reactions leading to dose reductions occurred in 9% of patients treated with TAGRISSO. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to dose reductions or interruptions were diarrhea (4.5%), stomatitis (3.9%), nail toxicity (1.8%) and rash (1.8%). Adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation occurred in 11% of patients treated with TAGRISSO. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of TAGRISSO were interstitial lung disease (2.7%), and rash (1.2%).

Table 2. Recommended Dosage of TAGRISSO Indication Recommended Dosage of TAGRISSO Duration of Treatment Adjuvant Treatment of EGFR Mutation-Positive NSCLC 80 mg tablet orally once daily with or without food For a total of 3 years or until disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity Locally Advanced, Unresectable (Stage III) EGFR Mutation-Positive NSCLC Following platinum-based chemoradiation therapy, 80 mg tablet orally once daily with or without food Until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity First-line Treatment of EGFR Mutation-Positive Metastatic NSCLC 80 mg tablet orally once daily with or without food Until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity First-line Treatment of EGFR Mutation-Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic NSCLC 80 mg tablet orally once daily with or without food in combination with pemetrexed and platinum-based chemotherapy Refer to the Prescribing Information for pemetrexed and cisplatin or carboplatin for the respective dosing information. Until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity due to TAGRISSO Previously Treated EGFR T790M Mutation-Positive Metastatic NSCLC 80 mg tablet orally once daily with or without food Until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity Administration Administer TAGRISSO 80 mg tablet orally once daily with or without food. Tablets may be dispersed in water for patients who have difficulty swallowing, or for nasogastric tube administration [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. Missed Dose If a dose of TAGRISSO is missed, do not make up the missed dose and take the next dose as scheduled. 2.4 Administration to Patients Who Have Difficulty Swallowing Solids Disperse TAGRISSO tablet in 60 mL (2 ounces) of non-carbonated water only. Stir until tablet is dispersed into small pieces (the tablet will not completely dissolve) and swallow immediately. Do not crush, heat, or ultrasonicate during preparation. Rinse the container with 120 mL to 240 mL (4 to 8 ounces) of water and immediately drink. If administration via nasogastric tube is required, disperse the TAGRISSO tablet as above in 15 mL of non-carbonated water, and then use an additional 15 mL of water to transfer any residues to the syringe. The resulting 30 mL liquid should be administered as per the nasogastric tube instructions with appropriate water flushes (approximately 30 mL). Repeat this step until no pieces remain in the syringe. This will help to ensure that the full prescribed dose of the TAGRISSO is given. The dispersion and residues should be administered within 30 minutes of the addition of the tablets to water. 2.5 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions The recommended dose reductions for adverse reactions are provided in Table 3.
