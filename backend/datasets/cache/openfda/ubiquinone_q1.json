    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Serious Meningococcal Infections [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Other Infections [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Monitoring Disease Manifestations after BKEMV Discontinuation [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Thrombosis Prevention and Management [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Infusion-Related Reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] The most frequently reported adverse reactions in the PNH randomized trial (\u226510% overall and greater than placebo) are: headache, nasopharyngitis, back pain, and nausea. ( 6.1 ) The most frequently reported adverse reactions in aHUS single arm prospective trials (\u226520%) are: headache, diarrhea, hypertension, upper respiratory infection, abdominal pain, vomiting, nasopharyngitis, anemia, cough, peripheral edema, nausea, urinary tract infections, pyrexia. ( 6.1 ) The most frequently reported adverse reaction in the gMG placebo-controlled clinical trial (\u226510%) is musculoskeletal pain.

Meningococcal infections are the most important adverse reactions experienced by patients receiving eculizumab. In PNH clinical studies, two patients experienced meningococcal sepsis. Both patients had previously received a meningococcal vaccine. In clinical studies among patients without PNH, meningococcal meningitis occurred in one unvaccinated patient. Meningococcal sepsis occurred in one previously vaccinated patient enrolled in the retrospective aHUS study during the post-study follow-up period [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. PNH The data described below reflect exposure to eculizumab in 196 adult patients with PNH, age 18-85, of whom 55% were female. All had signs or symptoms of intravascular hemolysis. Eculizumab was studied in a placebo-controlled clinical study (PNH Study 1, in which 43 patients received eculizumab and 44, placebo); a single arm clinical study (PNH Study 2); and a long term extension study (E05-001). One hundred and eighty two patients were exposed for greater than one year. All patients received the recommended eculizumab dose regimen. Table 4 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred at a numerically higher rate in the eculizumab group than the placebo group and at a rate of 5% or more among patients treated with eculizumab.

The serious reactions included infections and progression of PNH. No deaths occurred in the study and no patients receiving eculizumab experienced a thrombotic event; one thrombotic event occurred in a patient receiving placebo. Among 193 patients with PNH treated with eculizumab in the single arm, clinical study or the follow-up study, the adverse reactions were similar to those reported in the placebo-controlled clinical study. Serious adverse reactions occurred among 16% of the patients in these studies. The most common serious adverse reactions were: viral infection (2%), headache (2%), anemia (2%), and pyrexia (2%). aHUS The safety of eculizumab therapy in patients with aHUS was evaluated in four prospective, single-arm studies, three in adult and adolescent patients (Studies C08-002A/B, C08-003A/B, and C10-004), one in pediatric and adolescent patients (Study C10-003), and one retrospective study (Study C09-001r). The data described below were derived from 78 adult and adolescent patients with aHUS in Studies C08-002A/B, C08-003A/B and C10-004. All patients received the recommended dosage of eculizumab. Median exposure was 67 weeks (range: 2-145 weeks). Table 5 summarizes all adverse events reported in at least 10% of patients in Studies C08-002A/B, C08-003A/B and C10-004 combined.

The most commonly reported SAEs were infections (24%), hypertension (5%), chronic renal failure (5%), and renal impairment (5%). Five patients discontinued eculizumab due to adverse events; three due to worsening renal function, one due to new diagnosis of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, and one due to meningococcal meningitis. Study C10-003 included 22 pediatric and adolescent patients, of which 18 patients were less than 12 years of age. All patients received the recommended dosage of eculizumab. Median exposure was 44 weeks (range: 1 dose-87 weeks). Table 6 summarizes all adverse events reported in at least 10% of patients enrolled in Study C10-003.

The most commonly reported SAEs were hypertension (9%), viral gastroenteritis (9%), pyrexia (9%), and upper respiratory infection (9%). One patient discontinued eculizumab due to an adverse event (severe agitation). Analysis of retrospectively collected adverse event data from pediatric and adult patients enrolled in Study C09-001r (N=30) revealed a safety profile that was similar to that which was observed in the two prospective studies. Study C09-001r included 19 pediatric patients less than 18 years of age. Overall, the safety of eculizumab in pediatric patients with aHUS enrolled in Study C09-001r appeared similar to that observed in adult patients. The most common (\u226515%) adverse events occurring in pediatric patients are presented in Table 7.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to eculizumab products exposure. Adverse Reactions from Postmarketing Spontaneous Reports Fatal or serious infections: Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria sicca/subflava, Neisseria spp unspecified. Cases of cholestatic or mixed pattern liver injury with increased serum liver enzymes and bilirubin levels have been reported in adult and pediatric patients with aHUS who were treated with eculizumab. These events occurred within 3 to 27 days after starting treatment. The median time to resolution (or return to baseline) was approximately 3 weeks."

Transfer the recommended dose to an infusion bag. Dilute BKEMV to a final concentration of 5 mg/mL by adding the appropriate amount (equal volume of diluent to drug volume) of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP; 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP; 5% Dextrose in Water Injection, USP; or Ringer's Injection, USP to the infusion bag. The final admixed BKEMV 5 mg/mL infusion volume is 60 mL for 300 mg doses, 120 mL for 600 mg doses, 180 mL for 900 mg doses or 240 mL for 1,200 mg doses (Table 3). Table 3: Preparation and Reconstitution of BKEMV BKEMV Dose Diluent Volume Final Volume 300 mg 30 mL 60 mL 600 mg 60 mL 120 mL 900 mg 90 mL 180 mL 1,200 mg 120 mL 240 mL Gently invert the infusion bag containing the diluted BKEMV solution to ensure thorough mixing of the product and diluent. Discard any unused portion left in a vial, as the product contains no preservatives. Prior to administration, the admixture should be allowed to adjust to room temperature [18\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C (64\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F)]. The admixture must not be heated in a microwave or with any heat source other than ambient air temperature. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. 2.7 Administration Only administer as an intravenous infusion. Do not administer as an intravenous push or bolus injection. Administer the BKEMV admixture by intravenous infusion over 35 minutes in adults and 1 to 4 hours in pediatric patients via gravity feed, a syringe-type pump, or an infusion pump. Admixed solutions of BKEMV are stable for 64 hours at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) or 24 hours at room temperature. If an adverse reaction occurs during the administration of BKEMV, the infusion may be slowed or stopped at the discretion of the physician. If the infusion is slowed, the total infusion time should not exceed two hours in adults. Monitor the patient for at least one hour following completion of the infusion for signs or symptoms of an infusion-related reaction."
