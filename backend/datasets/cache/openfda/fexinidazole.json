    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Avoid use of herbal medicines and supplements. ( 7.1 ) See full prescribing information for complete list of clinically significant drug interactions. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Pharmacodynamic Interactions Herbal Medicines and Supplements There is a potential for pharmacodynamic interactions and/or toxicities between fexinidazole and herbal medicines and supplements. Avoid concomitant use of herbal medicines and supplements during treatment with Fexinidazole Tablets. Drugs that May Prolong the QT Interval and/or Induce Bradycardia Coadministration of Fexinidazole Tablets with drugs known to block potassium channels (e.g., antiarrhythmics, neuroleptics, fluoroquinolones, imidazole and triazole antifungals, pentamidine) prolong the QT interval (e.g., antimalarials, phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, terfenadine and astemizole, IV erythromycin, and quinolone antibacterial drugs) and/or induce bradycardia (such as \u03b2-blockers) should be avoided [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . 7.2 Pharmacokinetic Drug Interactions Table 3: Effect of Fexinidazole on other Drugs Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4/5 Examples (not fully inclusive): Lovastatin, simvastatin, nisoldipine, saquinavir, midazolam, certain hormonal contraceptives (e.g., birth control pills, skin patches, implant) Clinical Impact Fexinidazole is considered a moderate CYP3A4/5 inducer [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Co-administration of Fexinidazole Tablets and CYP3A4/5 substrates may reduce the systemic exposures of CYP3A4/5 substrate drug(s), which may lead to reduced efficacy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Prevention or Management Avoid concomitant use with Fexinidazole Tablets . If coadministration cannot be avoided, monitor for lack of efficacy of sensitive substrate drugs. If concomitant use of oral contraceptives cannot be avoided, an alternative contraceptive that is not affected by enzyme inducers (e.g., intrauterine system) or additional nonhormonal contraception (e.g., condoms) is recommended during treatment with Fexinidazole Tablets and for at least 5 days after the last dose. Drugs Metabolized by CYP1A2 or CYP2C19 Examples (not fully inclusive): CYP1A2: duloxetine, tacrine, tizanidine, theophylline CYP2C19: lansoprazole, mephenytoin, diazepam Clinical Impact Increased risk for adverse reactions associated with increased concentrations of the drug due to inhibition of either CYP1A2 or CYP2C19 by fexinidazole [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Prevention or Management Monitor for adverse reactions associated with these drugs when used concomitantly with Fexinidazole Tablets. Drugs Metabolized by CYP2B6 Examples (not fully inclusive): Bupropion, efavirenz Clinical Impact Increased risk for the lack of efficacy associated with decreased plasma concentrations of the drug due to induction of CYP2B6 by fexinidazole and Metabolite M1 [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Prevention or Management Avoid concomitant use with Fexinidazole Tablets. If coadministration cannot be avoided, monitor for lack of efficacy of these drugs. Drugs Metabolized by uridine 5'-diphospho--glucuronosyl transferase (UGT) Examples (not fully inclusive): Zidovudine, bictegravir, cabotegravir, dolutegravir, bexagliflozin, canagliflozin, sotagliflozin, deferasirox, lamotrigine, selexipag Clinical Impact Fexinidazole metabolites have the potential to be UGT inducers [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Co-administration of Fexinidazole Tablets and UGT substrates may reduce the systemic exposures of UGT substrate drug(s), which may lead to reduced efficacy. Prevention or Management When fexinidazole is concomitantly administered with UGT substrates, monitor for lack of efficacy of UGT substrate drugs. Drugs Substrates of OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, MATE1, and MATE2-K Transporters Examples (not fully inclusive): Metformin, dofetilide, adefovir, cefaclor, furosemide Clinical Impact Increased risk for adverse reactions associated with increased concentrations of the drug due to inhibition of these transporters by fexinidazole [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Prevention or Management Avoid concomitant use with Fexinidazole Tablets. If coadministration cannot be avoided, monitor for adverse reactions associated with these drugs. Table 4: Effect of other Drugs on Fexinidazole CYP450 Inducers Examples (not fully inclusive): Rifampin, phenytoin, St. John's wort, carbamazepine Clinical Impact Increased risk for adverse reactions associated with increased systemic exposure to the M1 and M2 metabolites of fexinidazole. M2 plasma concentrations have been associated with the increased risk of QT interval prolongation. Prevention or Management Avoid concomitant use with Fexinidazole Tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. CYP450 Inhibitors Examples (not fully inclusive): Clarithromycin, itraconazole, voriconazole, erythromycin, fluconazole Clinical Impact Multiple CYP450 enzymes are involved in the metabolism of fexinidazole to its pharmacologically active M1 and M2 metabolites. Although no clinical drug interaction studies were performed with CYP450 inhibitors, the formation of the M1 and M2 metabolites may be decreased. Prevention or Management Avoid concomitant use with Fexinidazole Tablets. If coadministration cannot be avoided, monitor for lack of efficacy of fexinidazole due to potential for decreased plasma concentrations of the M1 and M2 metabolites [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious and otherwise important adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of labeling: Decreased Efficacy in Severe Human African Trypanosomiasis Caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] QT Interval Prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Neuropsychiatric Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Neutropenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Potential for Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Most common adverse reactions (incidence >10%) are headache, vomiting, insomnia, nausea, asthenia, tremor, decreased appetite, dizziness, hypocalcemia, dyspepsia, back pain, upper abdominal pain, and hyperkalemia. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact sanofi-aventis U.S. LLC at 1-800-633-1610 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Fexinidazole Tablets were evaluated for the treatment of HAT due to T. brucei gambiense in three clinical trials, of which one was comparative and two were noncomparative. Trial 1 compared the safety of Fexinidazole Tablets to nifurtimox-eflornithine combination therapy (NECT) in second stage, meningoencephalitic HAT (N=394). Trial 2 enrolled patients with stage 1 hemolymphatic and early stage 2 HAT (N=230), and Trial 3 assessed the safety of fexinidazole in pediatric patients aged 6 years or older with any stage HAT (N=125). The three trials were primarily conducted in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and a total of 749 patients received at least one dose of study medication. The patients ranged from 6 to 73 years of age, and 11 were more than 65 years old. Trials 1 and 3 enrolled more males than females (61% and 54% were males, respectively), while the gender distribution was equally balanced in Trial 2. The mean BMI ranged from 16.1 to 19.3 kg/m 2 across trials which was consistent with the nutritional status of the study population. Patients with AST/ALT >2 times the upper limit of normal or total bilirubin >1.5 the upper limit of normal were excluded from the trials. Trial 1 included 264 patients in the fexinidazole treatment arm and 130 patients in the NECT treatment arm. The patients were followed for up to 24 months from the completion of treatment. Common Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions occurring in >10% of HAT patients (15 years of age and older) receiving Fexinidazole Tablets in Trial 1 were headache, vomiting, insomnia, nausea, asthenia, tremor, decreased appetite, dizziness, hypocalcemia, dyspepsia, back pain, upper abdominal pain, and hyperkalemia. Selected adverse reactions occurring in \u22652% of HAT patients 15 years of age and older receiving Fexinidazole Tablets in Trial 1 are provided in Table 2.

Specific Adverse Reactions Vomiting In the clinical trials, the incidence of vomiting within 30 minutes of administration of Fexinidazole Tablets was higher in pediatric patients (20%) than in adult patients (6.1%). There was a trend of increased incidence of vomiting during the loading phase. Generally, vomiting did not lead to treatment discontinuation. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reaction has been identified and reported during post-approval use of other nitroimidazole agents. Because the reports of this reaction are voluntary and the population is of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate the frequency of the reaction or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Metronidazole, Another Nitroimidazole Product, Structurally Related to Fexinidazole: Cases of severe irreversible hepatotoxicity/acute liver failure, including cases with fatal outcomes with very rapid onset after initiation of systemic use of metronidazole, another nitroimidazole agent structurally related to fexinidazole, have been reported in patients with Cockayne syndrome (latency from drug start to signs of liver failure as short as 2 days) [see Contraindications (4) ] ."
