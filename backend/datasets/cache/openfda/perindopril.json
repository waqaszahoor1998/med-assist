    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Diuretics: Excessive drop in blood pressure. (7.1) Potassium-Sparing Diuretics/Potassium Supplements: Hyperkalemia. (7.2) Lithium: Increase serum lithium levels, symptoms of lithium toxicity. (7.3) Injectable Gold: Nitritoid reactions (facial flushing, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension). (7.4) NSAID use may lead to increased risk of renal impairment and loss of antihypertensive effect. (7.7) Dual inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system: Increased risk of renal impairment, hypotension, and hyperkalemia. ( 7.8 ) Neprilysin Inhibitor: risk of angioedema ( 7 ). 7.1 Diuretics Patients on diuretics, and especially those started recently, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of perindopril erbumine therapy. The possibility of hypotensive effects can be minimized by either decreasing the dose of or discontinuing the diuretic or increasing the salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with perindopril. If diuretic therapy cannot be altered, provide close medical supervision with the first dose of perindopril erbumine, for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for another hour [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . The rate and extent of perindopril absorption and elimination are not affected by concomitant diuretics. The bioavailability of perindoprilat was reduced by diuretics, however, and this was associated with a decrease in plasma ACE inhibition. 7.2 Potassium Supplements and Potassium-Sparing Diuretics Perindopril erbumine may increase serum potassium because of its potential to decrease aldosterone production. Use of potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, amiloride, triamterene and others), potassium supplements or other drugs capable of increasing serum potassium (indomethacin, heparin, cyclosporine and others) can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. Therefore, if concomitant use of such agents is indicated, monitor the patient\u2019s serum potassium frequently. 7.3 Lithium Increased serum lithium and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving concomitant lithium and ACE inhibitor therapy. Frequent monitoring of serum lithium concentration is recommended. Use of a diuretic may further increase the risk of lithium toxicity. 7.4 Gold Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE Inhibitor therapy including perindopril erbumine. 7.5 Digoxin A controlled pharmacokinetic study has shown no effect on plasma digoxin concentrations when coadministered with perindopril erbumine, but an effect of digoxin on the plasma concentration of perindopril/perindoprilat has not been excluded. 7.6 Gentamicin Animal data have suggested the possibility of interaction between perindopril and gentamicin. However, this has not been investigated in human studies. 7.7 Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including perindopril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving perindopril and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, including perindopril, may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors. 7.8 Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two RAS inhibitors do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on perindopril erbumine and other agents that affect the RAS. Do not co-administer aliskiren with perindopril erbumine in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with perindopril erbumine in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 mL/min). 7.9 mTOR Inhibitors Patients taking concomitant mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitor therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 7.10 Neprilysin Inhibitor Patients taking concomitant neprilysin inhibitors may be at increased risk for angioedema.

    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse event rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Hypertension: Most common adverse events (incidence greater than or equal to 5%) are cough, dizziness and back pain. (6.1) Stable Coronary Artery Disease: Most common adverse events leading to discontinuation were cough, drug intolerance, and hypotension. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc. at 1-866-850-2876 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in labeling: Anaphylactoid reactions, including angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Neutropenia and agranulocytosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Impaired renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Hyperkalemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Cough [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Hypertension Perindopril erbumine has been evaluated for safety in approximately 3,400 patients with hypertension in U.S. and foreign clinical trials. The data presented here are based on results from the 1,417 perindopril erbumine-treated patients who participated in the U.S. clinical trials. Over 220 of these patients were treated with perindopril erbumine for at least one year. In placebo-controlled U.S. clinical trials, the incidence of premature discontinuation of therapy due to adverse events was 6.5% in patients treated with perindopril erbumine and 6.7% in patients treated with placebo. The most common causes were cough, headache, asthenia and dizziness. Among 1,012 patients in placebo-controlled U.S. trials, the overall frequency of reported adverse events was similar in patients treated with perindopril erbumine and in those treated with placebo (approximately 75% in each group). The only adverse events whose incidence on perindopril erbumine was at least 2% greater than on placebo were cough (12% vs. 4.5%) and back pain (5.8% vs. 3.1%). Dizziness was not reported more frequently in the perindopril group (8.2%) than in the placebo group (8.5%), but its likelihood increased with dose, suggesting a causal relationship with perindopril. Stable Coronary Artery Disease Perindopril has been evaluated for safety in EUROPA, a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 12,218 patients with stable coronary artery disease. The overall rate of discontinuation was about 22% on drug and placebo. The most common medical reasons for discontinuation that were more frequent on perindopril than placebo were cough, drug intolerance and hypotension. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Voluntary reports of adverse events in patients taking perindopril erbumine that have been received since market introduction and are of unknown causal relationship to perindopril erbumine include: cardiac arrest, eosinophilic pneumonitis, neutropenia/agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, anemia (including hemolytic and aplastic), thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure, nephritis, hepatic failure, jaundice (hepatocellular or cholestatic), symptomatic hyponatremia, bullous pemphigoid, pemphigus, acute pancreatitis, falls, psoriasis, exfoliative dermatitis and a syndrome which may include: arthralgia/arthritis, vasculitis, serositis, myalgia, fever, rash or other dermatologic manifestations, a positive antinuclear antibody (ANA), leukocytosis, eosinophilia or an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). 6.3 Clinical Laboratory Test Findings Hematology: Small decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit occur frequently in hypertensive patients treated with perindopril erbumine, but are rarely of clinical importance. In controlled clinical trials, no patient was discontinued from therapy due to the development of anemia. Leukopenia (including neutropenia) was observed in 0.1% of patients in U.S. clinical trials [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Liver Function Tests: Elevations in ALT (1.6% perindopril erbumine versus 0.9% placebo) and AST (0.5% perindopril erbumine versus 0.4% placebo) have been observed in placebo-controlled clinical trials. The elevations were generally mild and transient and resolved after discontinuation of therapy."

  "dosage_administration": [
    "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Hypertension The recommended initial dose is 4 mg once a day. The dosage may be titrated upward until blood pressure, when measured just before the next dose, is controlled or to a maximum of 16 mg per day. (2.1) Stable Coronary Artery Disease Perindopril erbumine tablets should be given at an initial dose of 4 mg once daily for 2 weeks, and then increased, as tolerated, to a maintenance dose of 8 mg once daily. (2.2) 2.1 Hypertension Use in Uncomplicated Hypertensive Patients: In patients with essential hypertension, the recommended initial dose is 4 mg once a day. The dose may be titrated, as needed to a maximum of 16 mg per day. The usual maintenance dose range is 4 mg to 8 mg administered as a single daily dose or in two divided doses. Use in Elderly Patients: The recommended initial daily dosage of perindopril erbumine tablets for the elderly is 4 mg daily, given in one or two divided doses. Experience with perindopril erbumine tablets is limited in the elderly at doses exceeding 8 mg. Dosages above 8 mg should be administered with careful blood pressure monitoring and dose titration [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Use with Diuretics: In patients who are currently being treated with a diuretic, symptomatic hypotension can occur following the initial dose of perindopril erbumine tablets. Consider reducing the dose of diuretic prior to starting perindopril erbumine tablets [see Drug Interactions (7.1) ] . 2.2 Stable Coronary Artery Disease In patients with stable coronary artery disease, perindopril erbumine tablets should be given at an initial dose of 4 mg once daily for 2 weeks, and then increased as tolerated, to a maintenance dose of 8 mg once daily. In elderly patients (greater than 70 years), perindopril erbumine tablets should be given as a 2 mg dose once daily in the first week, followed by 4 mg once daily in the second week and 8 mg once daily for maintenance dose if tolerated. 2.3 Dose Adjustment in Renal Impairment and Dialysis Perindoprilat elimination is decreased in renally impaired patients. Perindopril erbumine tablets are not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance <30 mL/min. For patients with lesser degrees of impairment, the initial dosage should be 2 mg/day and dosage should not exceed 8 mg/day. During dialysis, perindopril is removed with the same clearance as in patients with normal renal function."
