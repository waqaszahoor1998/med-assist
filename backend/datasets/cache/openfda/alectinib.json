    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Renal Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Bradycardia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Severe Myalgia and Creatine Phosphokinase (CPK) Elevation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Hemolytic Anemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Embryo-Fetal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] The most common adverse reactions (incidence \u226520%) were hepatotoxicity, constipation, fatigue, myalgia, edema, rash and cough. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Genentech at 1-888-835-2555 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflect exposure to ALECENSA as a single agent at 600 mg orally twice daily in 533 patients in Studies NP28761, NP28673, ALEX and ALINA [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. Among 533 patients who received ALECENSA, 75% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 64% were exposed for greater than one year. In this pooled safety population, the most common (\u2265 20%) adverse reactions were hepatotoxicity (41%), constipation (39%), fatigue (36%), myalgia (31%), edema (29%), rash (23%) and cough (21%). The most common (\u2265 2%) Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities were increased CPK (6%), decreased hemoglobin (4.4%), increased ALT (4.2%), increased bilirubin (4.0%) and increased AST (3.4%). Adjuvant Treatment of Resected ALK-Positive NSCLC The safety of ALECENSA was evaluated in ALINA, a multi-center, open-label, randomized trial for the adjuvant treatment of patients with resected ALK-positive NSCLC [ see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. At the time of DFS analysis, the median duration of exposure was 23.9 months for ALECENSA and 2.1 months for platinum-based chemotherapy. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 13% of patients treated with ALECENSA; the most frequent serious adverse reactions (\u2265 1%) were pneumonia (3.9%), appendicitis (3.1%), and acute myocardial infarction (1.6%). Permanent discontinuation of ALECENSA due to an adverse event occurred in 5% of patients; the most frequent adverse reactions (\u2265 1%) that led to treatment discontinuation were pneumonitis and hepatotoxicity. Dosage interruptions of ALECENSA due to an adverse reaction occurred in 27% of patients. Adverse reactions which required dosage interruption in \u2265 2% of patients included hepatotoxicity, increased blood CPK, COVID-19, myalgia, abdominal pain, and pneumonia. Dose reductions of ALECENSA due to an adverse reaction occurred in 26% of patients. Adverse reactions which required dose reductions in \u2265 2% of patients included hepatotoxicity, increased blood CPK, rash, bradycardia and myalgia. Table 4 and 5 summarize the common adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities observed in ALINA.
