    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Avoid the use of strong CYP3A4 inducers because they may decrease CAPRELSA exposure. ( 7.1 ) Avoid the use of agents that prolong the QT interval. ( 5.11 ) 7.1 Effect of CYP3A4 Inducers on CAPRELSA Rifampicin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, decreased vandetanib plasma concentrations. Avoid concomitant use of known strong CYP3A4 inducers during CAPRELSA therapy. Avoid concomitant use of St. John's wort because it can decrease vandetanib exposure unpredictably [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.2 Effect of CAPRELSA on OCT2 Transporter CAPRELSA increased plasma concentrations of metformin that is transported by the organic cation transporter type 2 (OCT2). Use caution and closely monitor for toxicities when administering CAPRELSA with drugs that are transported by OCT2 [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.3 Effect of CAPRELSA on Digoxin CAPRELSA increased plasma concentrations of digoxin. Use caution and closely monitor for toxicities when administering CAPRELSA with digoxin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.4 Drugs that Prolong the QT Interval Avoid concomitant use of CAPRELSA with agents that may prolong the QT interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] ."

( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, Contact Sanofi Genzyme at 1-800-817-2722 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic medullary thyroid cancer were treated with CAPRELSA 300 mg (n=231) or Placebo (n=99). The population exposed to CAPRELSA was 58% male, 94% white, and had a median age of 50 years. The data described below reflect a median exposure to CAPRELSA for 607 days. The most commonly reported adverse drug reactions which occurred in >20% of CAPRELSA-treated patients and with a between-arm difference of \u22655% included, in order of decreasing frequency: diarrhea/colitis, rash, acneiform dermatitis, hypertension, nausea, headache, upper respiratory tract infection, decreased appetite, and abdominal pain. Among CAPRELSA-treated patients, dose interruption occurred in 109 (47%) and dose reduction occurred in 83 (36%). Adverse reactions led to study treatment discontinuation in 28 of 231 patients (12%) receiving CAPRELSA and in 3 of 99 patients (3.0%) receiving placebo. Adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation in 2 or more (\u22650.9%) patients treated with CAPRELSA were: asthenia (1.7%), rash (1.7%), diarrhea (0.9%), fatigue (0.9%), pyrexia (0.9%), elevated creatinine (0.9%), QT prolongation (0.9%), and hypertension (0.9%).

Blurred vision was commonly reported (9% vs 1%) in this trial. Scheduled slit lamp examinations revealed corneal opacities (vortex keratopathies) in treated patients, which can lead to halos and decreased visual acuity. Perform ophthalmologic examination, including slit lamp examination, in patients who report visual changes. Grade 1 to 2 bleeding events were also more common in patients receiving CAPRELSA compared to placebo (14% vs 7%). Table 2: Per-Patient Incidence of Selected Laboratory Abnormalities in Patients with MTC Occurring at a Higher Incidence in CAPRELSA-Treated Patients (Between-Arm Difference of \u22655% [All Grades] CTCAE version 3 was used to grade laboratory abnormalities. ) Laboratory Abnormalities CAPRELSA 300 mg N=231 Placebo N=99 All Grades (%) Grade 3 or 4 (%) All Grades (%) Grade 3 or 4 (%) Chemistries Hypocalcemia 57 6 25 3 ALT Increased 51 2 19 0 Hypoglycemia 24 0 7 1 Creatinine Increased 16 0 1 0 Hypomagnesemia 7 <1 2 0 Hematologic Neutropenia 10 <1 5 2 Thrombocytopenia 9 0 3 0 No patient with a Grade 3 to 4 ALT elevation had a concomitant increase in bilirubin in the MTC study. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of CAPRELSA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Vascular disorders : Arterial (including aortic) aneurysms, dissections, and rupture Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders : Osteonecrosis General disorders: Impaired wound healing"

  "dosage_administration": [
    "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The recommended dose of CAPRELSA is 300 mg taken orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. CAPRELSA may be taken with or without food. Do not take a missed dose within 12 hours of the next dose. Do not crush CAPRELSA tablets. The tablets can be dispersed in 2 ounces of water by stirring for approximately 10 minutes (will not completely dissolve). Do not use other liquids for dispersion. Swallow immediately after dispersion. Mix any remaining residue with 4 additional ounces of water and swallow. The dispersion can also be administered through nasogastric or gastrostomy tubes. 300 mg once daily. ( 2 ) CAPRELSA may be taken with or without food. ( 2 ) Dosage reduction may be necessary in the event of severe toxicities or QTc interval prolongation. ( 2.1 ) The starting dose is 200 mg in patients with moderate renal impairment. ( 2.1 ) 2.1 Dosage Adjustment For Adverse Reactions The 300 mg daily dose can be reduced to 200 mg (two 100 mg tablets) and then to 100 mg for Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 3 or greater toxicities. Interrupt CAPRELSA for the following: Corrected QT interval, Fridericia (QTcF) greater than 500 ms: Resume at a reduced dose when the QTcF returns to less than 450 ms. CTCAE Grade 3 or greater toxicity: Resume at a reduced dose when the toxicity resolves or improves to CTCAE Grade 1. For recurrent toxicities, reduce the dose of CAPRELSA to 100 mg after resolution or improvement to CTCAE Grade 1 severity, if continued treatment is warranted. Adverse events including QT interval prolongation should be monitored closely as they may not resolve fully until approximately three plasma half-lives of the drug. Monitor appropriately [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , (5.2) , (5.3) , (5.4) , (5.5) , (5.6) , (5.7) , and (5.9) ] . For Patients with Renal Impairment Reduce the starting dose to 200 mg in patients with moderate (creatinine clearance \u226530 to <50 mL/min) renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . For Patients with Hepatic Impairment CAPRELSA is not recommended for use in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] ."
