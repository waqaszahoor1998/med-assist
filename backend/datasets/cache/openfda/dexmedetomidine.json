    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Anesthetics, Sedatives, Hypnotics, Opioids: Enhancement of pharmacodynamic effects. Reduction in dosage of dexmedetomidine or the concomitant medication may be required. (7.1) 7.1 Anesthetics, Sedatives, Hypnotics, Opioids Co-administration of dexmedetomidine with anesthetics, sedatives, hypnotics, and opioids is likely to lead to an enhancement of effects. Specific studies have confirmed these effects with sevoflurane, isoflurane, propofol, alfentanil, and midazolam. No pharmacokinetic interactions between dexmedetomidine and isoflurane, propofol, alfentanil and midazolam have been demonstrated. However, due to possible pharmacodynamic interactions, when co-administered with dexmedetomidine, a reduction in dosage of dexmedetomidine or the concomitant anesthetic, sedative, hypnotic or opioid may be required. 7.2 Neuromuscular Blockers In one study of 10 healthy adult volunteers, administration of dexmedetomidine for 45 minutes at a plasma concentration of one ng/mL resulted in no clinically meaningful increases in the magnitude of neuromuscular blockade associated with rocuronium administration."

    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: \u2022 Hypotension, bradycardia and sinus arrest [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] \u2022 Transient hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] \u2022 The most common adverse reactions (incidence >2%) in adults are hypotension, bradycardia, and dry mouth. (6.1) \u2022 Adverse reactions in adults, associated with infusions >24 hours in duration include ARDS, respiratory failure, and agitation. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact WG Critical Care at 1-866-562-4708 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Most common treatment-emergent adverse reactions, occurring in greater than 2% of adult patients in both Intensive Care Unit and procedural sedation studies include hypotension, bradycardia and dry mouth. Intensive Care Unit Sedation Adverse reaction information is derived from the continuous infusion trials of dexmedetomidine for sedation in the Intensive Care Unit setting in which 1,007 adult patients received dexmedetomidine. The mean total dose was 7.4 mcg/kg (range: 0.8 to 84.1), mean dose per hour was 0.5 mcg/kg/hr (range: 0.1 to 6.0) and the mean duration of infusion of 15.9 hours (range: 0.2 to 157.2). The population was between 17 to 88 years of age, 43% \u226565 years of age, 77% male and 93% Caucasian. Treatment-emergent adverse reactions occurring at an incidence of >2% are provided in Table 2. The most frequent adverse reactions were hypotension, bradycardia and dry mouth [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] .

The mean total dose was 1.6 mcg/kg (range: 0.5 to 6.7), mean dose per hour was 1.3 mcg/kg/hr (range: 0.3 to 6.1) and the mean duration of infusion of 1.5 hours (range: 0.1 to 6.2). The population was between 18 to 93 years of age, ASA I-IV, 30% \u2265 65 years of age, 52% male and 61% Caucasian. Treatment-emergent adverse reactions occurring in adults at an incidence of >2% are provided in Table 6. The most frequent adverse reactions were hypotension, bradycardia, and dry mouth [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . Pre-specified criteria for the vital signs to be reported as adverse reactions are footnoted below the table. The decrease in respiratory rate and hypoxia was similar between dexmedetomidine and comparator groups in both studies.

For patients over 65 years of age: Consider a dose reduction [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. For adult patients with impaired hepatic function: Consider a dose reduction [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 2.3 Dosage Adjustment Due to possible pharmacodynamic interactions, a reduction in dosage of dexmedetomidine or other concomitant anesthetics, sedatives, hypnotics or opioids may be required when co-administered [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] . Dosage reductions may need to be considered for adult patients with hepatic impairment, and geriatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8), Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 2.4 Preparation of Solution Strict aseptic technique must always be maintained during handling of Dexmedetomidine Injection and Dexmedetomidine in 5% Dextrose Injection. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use if product is discolored or if precipitate matter is present. Dexmedetomidine Injection, 400 mcg/4 mL (100 mcg/mL) and 1000 mcg/10 mL (100 mcg/mL) Dexmedetomidine Injection must be diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection to achieve required concentration (4 mcg/mL) prior to administration. Preparation of solutions is the same, whether for the loading dose or maintenance infusion. To prepare the solution, do one of the following: \u2022 Withdraw 2 mL of Dexmedetomidine Injection, and add to 48 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection to a total volume of 50 mL or \u2022 Withdraw 4 mL of Dexmedetomidine Injection, and add to 96 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection to a total of volume of 100 mL Gently shake and mix well. Prior to use, may store the diluted dexmedetomidine solution for up to 4 hours at room temperature or up to 24 hours at 2 o to 8 o C. Discard unused portion. Dexmedetomidine in 5% Dextrose Injection, 200 mcg/50 mL (4 mcg/mL) and 400 mcg/100 mL (4 mcg/mL) Dexmedetomidine in 5% Dextrose Injection is supplied in single-port, flexible plastic ready-to-use infusion bags with dexmedetomidine solution in 5% dextrose in water. No further dilution of these preparations is necessary. 2.5 Administration with Other Fluids Dexmedetomidine Injection and Dexmedetomidine in 5% Dextrose Injection should not be co-administered through the same intravenous catheter with blood or plasma because physical compatibility has not been established. Dexmedetomidine Injection and Dexmedetomidine in 5% Dextrose Injection has been shown to be incompatible when administered with the following drugs: amphotericin B, diazepam. Dexmedetomidine Injection and Dexmedetomidine in 5% Dextrose Injection is compatible with and may be co-administered with: \u2022 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection \u2022 5% Dextrose Injection in water \u2022 20% Mannitol Injection \u2022 Lactated Ringer\u2019s Injection \u2022 100 mg/mL Magnesium Sulfate Injection \u2022 0.3% potassium chloride solution 2.6 Compatibility with Natural Rubber Compatibility studies have demonstrated the potential for absorption of dexmedetomidine to some types of natural rubber. Although dexmedetomidine is dosed to effect, it is advisable to use administration components made with synthetic or coated natural rubber gaskets."
