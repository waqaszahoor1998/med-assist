    "7. DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 BCRP Substrates Tafamidis inhibits breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP) in humans [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Coadministration of tafamidis and drugs that are BCRP substrates may increase the exposure of substrates of this transporter (e.g., methotrexate, rosuvastatin, imatinib) and the risk of the substrate-related toxicities. Monitor for signs of BCRP substrate-related toxicities and modify dosage of the substrate if appropriate."

    "6. ADVERSE REACTIONS To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Pfizer Inc. at 1-800-438-1985 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data reflect exposure of 377 ATTR-CM patients to 20 mg or 80 mg (administered as four 20-mg capsules) of VYNDAQEL administered daily for an average of 24.5 months (ranging from 1 day to 111 months). Adverse events were assessed from ATTR-CM clinical trials with VYNDAQEL, primarily a 30-month placebo-controlled trial [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . The frequency of adverse events in patients treated with VYNDAQEL 20 mg (n=88) or 80 mg (n=176; administered as four 20-mg capsules) was similar to that with placebo (n=177). In the 30-month placebo-controlled trial, similar proportions of VYNDAQEL-treated patients and placebo-treated patients discontinued the study drug because of an adverse event: 12 (7%), 5 (6%), and 11 (6%) from the VYNDAQEL 80-mg, VYNDAQEL 20-mg, and placebo groups, respectively."
