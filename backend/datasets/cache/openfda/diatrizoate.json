    "WARNINGS Severe sensitivity reactions are more likely to occur in patients with a personal or family history of bronchial asthma, significant allergies, or previous reactions to contrast agents. A history of sensitivity to iodine per se or to other contrast agents is not an absolute contraindication to the use of diatrizoate meglumine, but calls for extreme caution in administration."

  "adverse_reactions": [
    "ADVERSE REACTIONS Retrograde genitourinary procedures may cause such complications as hematuria, perforation of the urethra or bladder, introduction of infection into the genitourinary tract, and oliguria or anuria. If intravasation of this drug occurs, the reactions which may be associated with intravenous administration may possibly be encountered. Hypersensitivity or anaphylactoid reactions may occur. Severe reactions may be manifested by edema of the face and glottis, respiratory distress, convulsions or shock; such reactions may prove fatal unless promptly controlled by such emergency measures as maintenance of a clear airway and immediate use of oxygen and resuscitative drugs. Endocrine: Thyroid function tests indicative of hypothyroidism or transient thyroid suppression have been uncommonly reported following iodinated contrast media administration to adult and pediatric patients, including infants. Some patients were treated for hypothyroidism."

  "dosage_administration": [
    "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Preparation of the patient: Appropriate preparation is desirable for optimal results. A laxative the night before the examination and a low residue diet the day before the procedure are recommended. Dosage: The dose for retrograde use in cystography and voiding cystourethrography ranges from 25 to 300 mL depending on the age of the patient and the degree of bladder irritability; amounts greater than 300 mL may be used if the bladder capacity allows. Best results are obtained when the bladder is filled with the contrast agent. If desired, the preparation may be diluted with sterile water or sterile saline as indicated in the table below. Administration: After sterile catheterization, the bladder should be filled to capacity with Cystografin using a suitable sterile administration set. Care should be taken to avoid using excessive pressure. The presence of bladder discomfort or reflux and/or spontaneous voiding usually indicates that the bladder is full. Radiography: The commonly employed radiographic techniques should be used. A scout film is recommended before the contrast agent is administered.
