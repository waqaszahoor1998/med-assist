    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS CYP3A4 Inhibitors Co-administration of erlotinib tablets with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor or a combined CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 inhibitor increased erlotinib exposure. Erlotinib is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP1A2. Increased erlotinib exposure may increase the risk of exposure-related toxicity [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Avoid co-administering erlotinib tablets with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., boceprevir, clarithromycin, conivaptan, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir/ritonavir, nefazodone, nel\ufb01navir, posaconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, voriconazole, grapefruit or grapefruit juice) or a combined CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 inhibitor (e.g., cipro\ufb02oxacin). Reduce the erlotinib tablets dosage when co-administering with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor or a combined CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 inhibitor if co-administration is unavoidable [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . CYP3A4 Inducers Pre-treatment with a CYP3A4 inducer prior to erlotinib tablets decreased erlotinib exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Increase the erlotinib tablets dosage if co-administration with CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital and St. John's wort) is unavoidable [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. CYP1A2 Inducers and Cigarette Smoking Cigarette smoking decreased erlotinib exposure. Avoid smoking tobacco (CYP1A2 inducer) and avoid concomitant use of erlotinib tablets with moderate CYP1A2 inducers (e.g., teri\ufb02unomide, rifampin, or phenytoin). Increase the erlotinib tablets dosage in patients that smoke tobacco or when co-administration with moderate CYP1A2 inducers is unavoidable [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Drugs the Increase Gastric pH Co-administration of erlotinib tablets with proton pump inhibitors (e.g., omeprazole) and H-2 receptor antagonists (e.g., ranitidine) decreased erlotinib exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . For proton pump inhibitors, avoid concomitant use if possible. For H-2 receptor antagonists and antacids, modify the dosing schedule [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. Increasing the dose of erlotinib when co-administered with gastric PH elevating agents is not likely to compensate for the loss of exposure. Anticoagulants Interaction with coumarin-derived anticoagulants, including warfarin, leading to increased International Normalized Ratio (INR) and bleeding adverse reactions, which in some cases were fatal, have been reported in patients receiving erlotinib tablets. Regularly monitor prothrombin time or INR in patients taking coumarin-derived anticoagulants. Dose modi\ufb01cations of erlotinib tablets are not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . CYP3A4 inhibitors or a combined CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 inhibitor increase erlotinib plasma concentrations. Avoid concomitant use. If not possible, reduce erlotinib dose. ( 2.4 , 7 ) CYP3A4 inducers decrease erlotinib plasma concentrations. Avoid concomitant use. If not possible, increase erlotinib dose. ( 2.4 , 7 ) Cigarette smoking and CYP1A2 inducers decrease erlotinib plasma concentrations. Avoid concomitant use. If not possible, increase erlotinib dose. ( 2.4, 7 ) Drugs that increase gastric pH decrease erlotinib plasma concentrations. For proton pump inhibitors avoid concomitant use if possible. For H-2 receptor antagonists, take erlotinib 10 hours after H-2 receptor antagonist dosing. For use with antacids, separate dosing by several hours. ( 2.4 , 7 )"

    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions, which may include fatalities, are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Renal Failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Hepatotoxicity with or without Hepatic Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Gastrointestinal Perforation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Bullous and Exfoliative Skin Disorders [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Cerebrovascular Accident [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Microangiopathic Hemolytic Anemia with Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Ocular Disorders [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Hemorrhage in Patients Taking Warfarin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] The most common adverse reactions (\u226520%) with erlotinib tablets from a pooled analysis in patients with NSCLC across all approved lines of therapy, with and without EGFR mutations, and in patients with pancreatic cancer were rash, diarrhea, anorexia, fatigue, dyspnea, cough, nausea, and vomiting. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact 1-888-557-1212 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or http://www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Safety Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not re\ufb02ect the rates observed in practice. Safety evaluation of erlotinib tablet is based on more than 1200 cancer patients who received erlotinib tablet as monotherapy, more than 300 patients who received erlotinib tablet 100 or 150 mg plus gemcitabine, and 1228 patients who received erlotinib tablet concurrently with other chemotherapies. The most common adverse reactions with erlotinib tablet are rash and diarrhea usually with onset during the \ufb01rst month of treatment. The incidences of rash and diarrhea from clinical studies of erlotinib tablet for the treatment of NSCLC and pancreatic cancer were 70% for rash and 42% for diarrhea. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer First-Line Treatment of Patients with EGFR Mutations The most frequent (\u2265 30%) adverse reactions in erlotinib tablets-treated patients were diarrhea, asthenia, rash, cough, dyspnea, and decreased appetite. In erlotinib tablets-treated patients the median time to onset of rash was 15 days and the median time to onset of diarrhea was 32 days. The most frequent Grade 3-4 adverse reactions in erlotinib tablets-treated patients were rash and diarrhea. Dose interruptions or reductions due to adverse reactions occurred in 37% of erlotinib tabletstreated patients, and 14.3% of erlotinib tablets-treated patients discontinued therapy due to adverse reactions. In erlotinib tablets-treated patients, the most frequently reported adverse reactions leading to dose modi\ufb01cation were rash (13%), diarrhea (10%), and asthenia (3.6%). Common adverse reactions in Study 1,occurring in at least 10% of patients who received erlotinib tablets or chemotherapy and an increase in \u2265 5% in the erlotinib tablets-treated group, are graded by National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0 (NCI-CTCAE v3.0) Grade in Table 1. The median duration of erlotinib tablets treatment was 9.6 months in Study 1. Table 1: Adverse Reactions with an Incidence Rate \u2265 10% and an Increase of \u2265 5% in the erlotinib tablets-Treated Group (Study 1) Erlotinib Tablets N = 84 Chemotherapy \u2020 N = 83 Adverse Reaction All Grades % Grades 3-4 % All Grades % Grades 3-4 % Rash \u2021 85 14 5 0 Diarrhea 62 5 21 1 Cough 48 1 40 0 Dyspnea 45 8 30 4 Dry skin 21 1 2 0 Back pain 19 2 5 0 Chest pain 18 1 12 0 Conjunctivitis 18 0 0 0 Mucosal inflammation 18 1 6 0 Pruritus 16 0 1 0 Paronychia 14 0 0 0 Arthralgia 13 1 6 1 Musculoskeletal pain 11 1 1 0 \u2020 Platinum-based chemotherapy (cisplatin or carboplatin with gemcitabine or docetaxel). \u2021 Rash as a composite term includes rash, acne, folliculitis, erythema, acneiform dermatitis, dermatitis, palmarplantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, exfoliative rash, erythematous rash, rash pruritic, skin toxicity, eczema, follicular rash, skin ulcer. Hepatic Toxicity: One erlotinib-treated patient experienced fatal hepatic failure and four additional patients experienced grade 3-4 liver test abnormalities in Study 1 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Maintenance Treatment Adverse reactions, regardless of causality, that occurred in at least 3% of patients treated with single-agent erlotinib tablets at 150 mg and at least 3% more often than in the placebo group in the randomized maintenance trial (Study 3) are summarized by NCI-CTCAE v3.0 Grade in Table 2. The most common adverse reactions in patients receiving single-agent erlotinib tablets 150 mg were rash and diarrhea. Grade 3-4 rash and diarrhea occurred in 9% and 2%, respectively, in erlotinib tablets-treated patients. Rash and diarrhea resulted in study discontinuation in 1% and 0.5% of erlotinib tablets-treated patients, respectively. Dose reduction or interruption for rash and diarrhea was needed in 5% and 3% of patients, respectively. In erlotinib tablets-treated patients the median time to onset of rash was 10 days, and the median time to onset of diarrhea was 15 days. Table 2: NSCLC Maintenance Study: Adverse Reactions Occurring with an Incidence Rate \u2265 10% and an Increase of \u2265 5% in the Single-Agent Erlotinib Tablets Group compared to the Placebo Group (Study 3) Adverse Reaction ERLOTINIB TABLETS N = 433 PLACEBO N = 445 Any Grade % Grade 3% Grade 4% Any Grade % Grade 3% Grade 4% Rash \u2020 60 9 0 9 0 0 Diarrhea 20 2 0 4 0 0 \u2020 Rash as a composite term includes: rash, acne, acneiform dermatitis, skin \ufb01ssures, erythema, papular rash, rash generalized, pruritic rash, skin exfoliation, urticaria, dermatitis, eczema, exfoliative rash, exfoliative dermatitis, furuncle, macular rash, pustular rash, skin hyperpigmentation, skin reaction, skin ulcer. Liver test abnormalities including ALT elevations were observed at Grade 2 or greater severity in 3% of erlotinib tablets-treated patients and 1% of placebo-treated patients. Grade 2 and above bilirubin elevations were observed in 5% of erlotinib tablets patients and in < 1% in the placebo group [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Second/Third Line Treatment Adverse reactions, regardless of causality, that occurred in at least 10% of patients treated with single-agent erlotinib tablets at 150 mg and at least 5% more often than in the placebo group in the randomized trial of patients with NSCLC are summarized by NCI-CTC v2.0 Grade in Table 3. The most common adverse reactions in this patient population were rash and diarrhea. Grade 3-4 rash and diarrhea occurred in 9% and 6%, respectively, in erlotinib tablets -treated patients. Rash and diarrhea each resulted in study discontinuation in 1% of erlotinib tablets -treated patients. Six percent and 1% of patients needed dose reduction for rash and diarrhea, respectively. The median time to onset of rash was 8 days, and the median time to onset of diarrhea was 12 days.

Liver function test abnormalities [including elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and bilirubin] were observed in patients receiving single-agent erlotinib tablet 150 mg. These elevations were mainly transient or associated with liver metastases. Grade 2 [>2.5\u20135.0 x upper limit of normal (ULN)] ALT elevations occurred in 4% and< 1% of erlotinib tablets and placebo treated patients, respectively. Grade 3 (>5.0\u201320.0 x ULN) elevations were not observed in erlotinib tablets-treated patients. Erlotinib tablets dosing should be interrupted or discontinued if changes in liver function are severe [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Pancreatic Cancer - erlotinib tablets Administered Concurrently with Gemcitabine This was a randomized, double\u2013blind, placebo-controlled study of erlotinib tablets (150 mg or 100 mg daily) or placebo plus gemcitabine (1000 mg/m 2 by intravenous infusion) in patients with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic pancreatic cancer (Study 5). The safety population comprised 282 patients in the erlotinib group (259 in the 100 mg cohort and 23 in the 150 mg cohort) and 280 patients in the placebo group (256 in the 100 mg cohort and 24 in the 150 mg cohort). Adverse reactions that occurred in at least 10% of patients treated with erlotinib tablet 100 mg plus gemcitabine in the randomized trial of patients with pancreatic cancer (Study 5) were graded according to NCI-CTC v2.0 in Table 4. The most common adverse reactions in pancreatic cancer patients receiving erlotinib tablet 100 mg plus gemcitabine were fatigue, rash, nausea, anorexia and diarrhea. In the erlotinib tablets plus gemcitabine arm, Grade 3-4 rash and diarrhea were each reported in 5% of patients. The median time to onset of rash and diarrhea was 10 days and 15 days, respectively. Rash and diarrhea each resulted in dose reductions in 2% of patients, and resulted in study discontinuation in up to 1% of patients receiving erlotinib tablet plus gemcitabine. Severe adverse reactions (\u2265 Grade 3 NCI-CTC) in the erlotinib tablet plus gemcitabine group with incidences < 5% included syncope, arrhythmias, ileus, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia including microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with thrombocytopenia, myocardial infarction/ischemia, cerebrovascular accidents including cerebral hemorrhage, and renal insuf\ufb01ciency[see Warnings and Precautions (5) ]. The 150 mg cohort was associated with a higher rate of certain class-specific adverse reactions including rash and required more frequent dose reduction or interruption.

Ten patients (4%) in the erlotinib/gemcitabine group and three patients (1%) in the placebo/gemcitabine group developed deep venous thrombosis. The overall incidence of grade 3 or 4 thrombotic events, including deep venous thrombosis was 11% for Erlotinib tablets plus gemcitabine and 9% for placebo plus gemcitabine. The incidences of liver test abnormalities (\u2265 Grade 2) in Study 5 are provided in Table 5 [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ].

These adverse reactions were reported as peptic ulcer bleeding (gastritis, gastroduodenal ulcers), hematemesis, hematochezia, melena and hemorrhage from possible colitis. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of erlotinib tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: Myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, in combination with statin therapy. Eye Disorders: ocular inflammation including uveitis."
