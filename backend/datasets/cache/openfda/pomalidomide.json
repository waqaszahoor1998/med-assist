    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors: Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP1A2 inhibitors. If concomitant use of a strong CYP1A2 inhibitor is unavoidable, reduce POMALYST dose to 2 mg ( 2.6 , 7.1 , 12.3 ). 7.1 Drugs That Affect Pomalidomide Plasma Concentrations CYP1A2 inhibitors : In healthy subjects, co-administration of fluvoxamine, a strong CYP1A2 inhibitor, increased C max and AUC of pomalidomide by 24% and 125% respectively [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Increased pomalidomide exposure may increase the risk of exposure related toxicities. Avoid co-administration of strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g. ciprofloxacin and fluvoxamine) . If co-administration is unavoidable, reduce the POMALYST dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] ."

Multiple Myeloma (MM) In Trial 1, data were evaluated from 219 patients (safety population) who received treatment with POMALYST + Low-dose Dex (112 patients) or POMALYST alone (107 patients). Median number of treatment cycles was 5. Sixty-seven percent of patients in the study had a dose interruption of either drug due to adverse reactions. Forty-two percent of patients in the study had a dose reduction of either drug due to adverse reactions. The discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 11%. In Trial 2, data were evaluated from 450 patients (safety population) who received treatment with POMALYST + Low-dose Dex (300 patients) or High-dose Dexamethasone (High-dose Dex) (150 patients). The median number of treatment cycles for the POMALYST + Low-dose Dex arm was 5. In the POMALYST + Low-dose Dex arm, 67% of patients had a dose interruption of POMALYST, the median time to the first dose interruption of POMALYST was 4.1 weeks. Twenty-seven percent of patients had a dose reduction of POMALYST, the median time to the first dose reduction of POMALYST was 4.5 weeks. Eight percent of patients discontinued POMALYST due to adverse reactions. Tables 3 and 4 summarize the adverse reactions reported in Trials 1 and 2, respectively. Table 3: Adverse Reactions in Any POMALYST Treatment Arm in Trial 1* * Regardless of attribution of relatedness to POMALYST. a POMALYST alone arm includes all patients randomized to the POMALYST alone arm who took study drug; 61 of the 107 patients had dexamethasone added during the treatment period. b Serious adverse reactions were reported in at least 2 patients in any POMALYST treatment arm.

Twenty-eight patients received POMALYST 5 mg taken orally once daily on Days 1 through 21 of repeated 28-day cycles. The study excluded patients with procoagulant disorders or a history of venous or arterial thromboembolism. Patients received DVT prophylaxis with daily low dose aspirin. Across all patients treated on Trial 12-C-0047, 75% were exposed to pomalidomide for 6 months or longer and 25% were exposed for greater than one year. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 18% (5/28) of patients who received POMALYST. The following serious adverse reactions each occurred in 1 patient: anemia, decreased neutrophil count, and hematuria. Permanent discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 11% (3/28) of patients who received POMALYST. Dosage interruptions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 14% (4/28) of patients who received POMALYST. The most frequent adverse reaction requiring dosage interruption was decreased neutrophil count, which occurred in 3 patients. The POMALYST dose was reduced due to an adverse reaction in 1 patient due to gout. Tables 5 and 6 summarize the adverse reactions and select laboratory abnormalities reported in Trial 12-C-0047.
