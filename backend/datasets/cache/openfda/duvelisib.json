( 7.2 ) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on COPIKTRA Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Coadministration with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor increases duvelisib AUC [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , which may increase the risk of COPIKTRA toxicities. Reduce COPIKTRA dosage when co-administered with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . Strong and Moderate CYP3A4 Inducers Coadministration with a strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducer decreases duvelisib area under the curve (AUC) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , which may reduce COPIKTRA efficacy. Avoid coadministration of strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers with COPIKTRA. If coadministration with a moderate CYP3A4 inducer cannot be avoided, increase the COPIKTRA dose. [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.2 Effects of COPIKTRA on Other Drugs CYP3A4 Substrates Coadministration with COPIKTRA increases AUC of a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] which may increase the risk of toxicities of these drugs. Consider reducing the dose of the sensitive CYP3A4 substrate and monitor for signs of toxicities of the co-administered sensitive CYP3A4 substrate."

Summary of Clinical Trial Experience in B-cell Malignancies The data described below reflect exposure to COPIKTRA in two single-arm, open-label clinical trials, one open-label extension clinical trial, and one randomized, open-label, actively controlled clinical trial totaling 442 patients with previously treated hematologic malignancies primarily including CLL/SLL (69%) and FL (22%). Patients were treated with COPIKTRA 25 mg BID until unacceptable toxicity or progressive disease. The median duration of exposure was 9 months (range: 0.1 to 53 months), with 36% (160/442) of patients having at least 12 months of exposure. For the 442 patients, the median age was 67 years (range: 30 to 90 years), 65% were male, 92% were White, and 93% had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1. Patients had a median of 2 prior therapies. The trials required hepatic transaminases at least \u2264 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN), total bilirubin \u2264 1.5 times ULN, and serum creatinine \u2264 1.5 times ULN. Patients were excluded for prior exposure to a PI3K inhibitor within 4 weeks. Fatal adverse reactions within 30 days of the last dose occurred in 36 patients (8%) treated with COPIKTRA 25 mg BID. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 289 patients (65%). The most frequent serious adverse reactions that occurred were infection (31%), diarrhea or colitis (18%), pneumonia (17%), rash (5%), and pneumonitis (5%). Adverse reactions resulted in treatment discontinuation in 156 patients (35%), most often due to diarrhea or colitis, infection, and rash. COPIKTRA was dose reduced in 104 patients (24%) due to adverse reactions, most often due to diarrhea or colitis and transaminase elevation. The median time to first dose modification or discontinuation was 4 months (range: 0.1 to 27 months), with 75% of patients having their first dose modification or discontinuation within 7 months. Common Adverse Reactions Table 4 summarizes common adverse reactions in patients receiving COPIKTRA 25 mg BID, and Table 5 summarizes the treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities. The most common adverse reactions (reported in \u2265 20% of patients) were diarrhea or colitis, neutropenia, rash, fatigue, pyrexia, cough, nausea, upper respiratory infection, pneumonia, musculoskeletal pain, and anemia.

Summary of Clinical Trial Experience in CLL/SLL DUO Study The safety data below reflects exposure in a randomized, open-label, actively controlled clinical trial for adult patients with CLL or SLL who received at least one prior therapy. Of 313 patients treated, 158 received COPIKTRA monotherapy and 155 received ofatumumab. The 442-patient safety analysis above includes patients from DUO [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . COPIKTRA was administered at 25 mg BID in 28-day treatment cycles until unacceptable toxicity or progressive disease. The comparator group received 12 doses of ofatumumab with an initial dose of 300 mg intravenous (IV) on Day 1 followed a week later by 7 weekly doses of 2000 mg IV, followed 4 weeks later by 2000 mg IV every 4 weeks for 4 doses. In the total study population, the median age was 69 years (range: 39 to 90 years), 60% were male, 92% were White, and 91% had an ECOG performance status of 0 to 1. Patients had a median of 2 prior therapies, with 61% of patients having received 2 or more prior therapies. The trial required a hemoglobin \u2265 8 g/dL and platelets \u2265 10,000 \u00b5L with or without transfusion support, hepatic transaminases \u2264 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN), total bilirubin \u2264 1.5 times ULN, and serum creatinine \u2264 2 times ULN. The trial excluded patients with prior autologous transplant within 6 months or allogeneic transplant, prior exposure to a PI3K inhibitor or a Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, and uncontrolled autoimmune hemolytic anemia or idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] During randomized treatment, the median duration of exposure to COPIKTRA was 11.6 months with 72% (114/158) exposed for \u2265 6 months and 49% (77/158) exposed for \u2265 1 year. The median duration of exposure to ofatumumab was 5.3 months, with 77% (120/155) receiving at least 10 of 12 doses. Fatal adverse reactions within 30 days of the last dose occurred in 12% (19/158) of patients treated with COPIKTRA and in 4% (7/155) of patients treated with ofatumumab. Serious adverse reactions were reported in 73% (115/158) of patients treated with COPIKTRA and most often involved infection (38% of patients; 60/158) and diarrhea or colitis (23% of patients; 36/158). COPIKTRA was discontinued in 57 patients (36%), most often due to diarrhea or colitis, infection, and rash. COPIKTRA was dose reduced in 46 patients (29%) due to adverse reactions, most often due to diarrhea or colitis and rash. Common Adverse Reactions Table 6 summarizes selected adverse reactions in Study 1, and Table 7 summarizes treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities. The most common adverse reactions with COPIKTRA (reported in \u2265 20% of patients) were diarrhea or colitis, neutropenia, pyrexia, upper respiratory tract infection, pneumonia, rash, fatigue, nausea, anemia and cough.

The data above are not an adequate basis for comparison of rates between the study drug and the active control. Long-Term Safety Follow-Up The comparative safety data from the 5 year follow up in those treated with either COPIKTRA (n=158) or ofatumumab (n=155) were analyzed in adult patients with CLL or SLL as part of a randomized, open-label, actively controlled clinical trial (DUO) [see Clinical Studies (14)] . Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 15% (23/158) of patients treated with COPIKTRA and in 3% (5/155) of patients treated with ofatumumab. The most common fatal adverse reactions in the COPIKTRA arm were infections and respiratory adverse reactions, occurring in 9% and 3% of patients, respectively."

    "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 25 mg orally, twice daily. Modify dosage for toxicity. ( 2.1 , 2.2 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosage The recommended dose of COPIKTRA is 25 mg administered as oral capsules twice daily (BID) with or without food. A cycle consists of 28 days. The capsules should be swallowed whole. Advise patients not to open, break, or chew the capsules. Advise patients that if a dose is missed by fewer than 6 hours, to take the missed dose right away and take the next dose as usual. If a dose is missed by more than 6 hours, advise patients to wait and take the next dose at the usual time. 2.2 Recommended Prophylaxis Provide prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jirovecii (PJP) during treatment with COPIKTRA. Following completion of COPIKTRA treatment, continue PJP prophylaxis until the absolute CD4+ T cell count is greater than 200 cells/\u00b5L. Withhold COPIKTRA in patients with suspected PJP of any grade, and discontinue if PJP is confirmed. Consider prophylactic antivirals during COPIKTRA treatment to prevent cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection including CMV reactivation. 2.3 Dose Modifications for Adverse Reactions Manage toxicities per Table 1 with dose reduction, treatment hold, or discontinuation of COPIKTRA.
