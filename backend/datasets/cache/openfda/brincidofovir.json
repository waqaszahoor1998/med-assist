    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant use with OATP1B1 and 1B3 inhibitors increase TEMBEXA exposure which may increase TEMBEXA-associated adverse reactions. Consider alternative medication that are not OATP1B1 or 1B3 inhibitors. If concomitant use is necessary, increase monitoring for adverse reactions associated with TEMBEXA and postpone the dosing of OATP1B1 or 1B3 inhibitors at least 3 hours after TEMBEXA administration. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on TEMBEXA Inhibitors for Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 and 1B3 Concomitant use of TEMBEXA with OATP1B1 and 1B3 inhibitors (clarithromycin, cyclosporine, erythromycin, gemfibrozil, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] and hepatitis C virus [HCV] protease inhibitors, rifampin [single dose]) increase brincidofovir AUC and C max which may increase TEMBEXA-associated adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Where possible, consider alternative medications that are not OATP1B1 or 1B3 inhibitors. If concomitant use with TEMBEXA is necessary, increase monitoring for adverse reactions associated with TEMBEXA (elevations in transaminases and bilirubin, diarrhea, or other GI adverse events) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 , 5.3 )] and postpone the dosing of OATP1B1 or 1B3 inhibitors for at least 3 hours after TEMBEXA administration. 7.2 Vaccine Interactions No vaccine-drug interaction studies have been performed in human subjects. Animal studies have indicated that coadministration of TEMBEXA at the same time as live smallpox vaccine (vaccinia virus) may reduce the immune response to the vaccine. It is also possible that TEMBEXA may reduce the immune response to replication-defective smallpox vaccine (modified vaccinia virus Ankara). The clinical impacts of these potential interactions on vaccine efficacy are unknown."

    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: \u2022 Elevations in hepatic transaminases and bilirubin [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] \u2022 Diarrhea and other GI adverse events [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Common adverse reactions (occurring in at least 2% of TEMBEXA-treated subjects) were diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Emergent BioDefense Operations Lansing LLC at 1-877-246-8472 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of TEMBEXA has not been studied in patients with smallpox disease. The safety of TEMBEXA was evaluated in 392 adult subjects aged 18 to 77 years in Phase 2 and 3 randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials. Of the subjects who received a 200 mg total weekly dose of TEMBEXA, 54% were male, 85% were White, 7% were Black/African American, 6% were Asian, and 10% were Hispanic or Latino. Twenty-one percent of subjects in the studies were age 65 or older. Of these 392 subjects, 85% received a 200 mg total weekly dose of TEMBEXA for at least 2 weeks. Common Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions (adverse events assessed as causally related by the investigator) experienced in the first 2 weeks of dosing with TEMBEXA were diarrhea and nausea. Adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2% of subjects in the TEMBEXA treatment group are shown in Table 2 . Table 2: Adverse Reactions (All Grades) Reported in \u22652% of Subjects Note: Only adverse reactions with onset in the first 2 weeks of treatment are presented. a. Composite term includes: bowel movement irregularity, defecation urgency, diarrhea, fecal incontinence, and frequent bowel movements. b. Composite term includes: vomiting and retching. c. Composite term includes: abdominal discomfort, abdominal distention, abdominal pain, abdominal pain lower, abdominal pain upper, abdominal tenderness, and gastrointestinal pain.

One subject had two adverse reactions; the other subjects had one reaction each. These adverse reactions were: \u2022 Diarrhea (n=9) \u2022 Nausea (n=3) \u2022 Vomiting (n=1) \u2022 Enteritis (n=1) \u2022 ALT increased (n=1) \u2022 Dyspepsia (n=1) These adverse reactions were mild (Grade 1, n=1), moderate (Grade 2, n=7) or severe (Grade 3, n=8) in severity and resolved upon discontinuation of TEMBEXA. Less Common Adverse Reactions Clinically significant adverse reactions that were reported in <2% of subjects (and also occurred in 2 or more subjects) exposed to TEMBEXA and at rates higher than in subjects who received placebo are listed below: \u2022 General and administration site: peripheral edema \u2022 Metabolism and nutrition: decreased appetite \u2022 Musculoskeletal and connective tissue: muscular weakness \u2022 Nervous system: dysgeusia \u2022 Skin and subcutaneous tissue: rash (includes rash, maculo-papular rash, pruritic rash) Selected treatment-emergent laboratory values occurring during the first 2 weeks of treatment with TEMBEXA are presented in Table 3 . Table 3: Frequencies of Selected Laboratory Abnormalities ULN = upper limit of normal a. Frequencies are based on treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities. Graded per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03 toxicity grading criteria. b.
