    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022 Strong CYP3A4 inducers: Avoid strong CYP3A4 inducers. ( 7.1 ) \u2022 Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors: Avoid strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. ( 7.2 ) \u2022 BCRP substrates: Monitor patients closely for symptoms of increased exposure to BCRP substrates. ( 7.3 ) 7.1 Effect of Strong CYP3A4 Inducers on Regorafenib Co-administration of a strong CYP3A4 inducer with STIVARGA decreased the plasma concentrations of regorafenib, increased the plasma concentrations of the active metabolite M-5, and resulted in no change in the plasma concentrations of the active metabolite M-2 [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , and may lead to decreased efficacy. Avoid concomitant use of STIVARGA with strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and St. John\u2019s Wort). 7.2 Effect of Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors on Regorafenib Co-administration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor with STIVARGA increased the plasma concentrations of regorafenib and decreased the plasma concentrations of the active metabolites M-2 and M-5 [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , and may lead to increased toxicity. Avoid concomitant use of STIVARGA with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. clarithromycin, grapefruit juice, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, posaconazole, telithromycin, and voriconazole). 7.3 Effect of Regorafenib on Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) Substrates Co-administration of STIVARGA with a BCRP substrate increased the plasma concentrations of the BCRP substrate [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Monitor patients closely for signs and symptoms of exposure related toxicity to the BCRP substrate (e.g. methotrexate, fluvastatin, atorvastatin). Consult the concomitant BCRP substrate product information when considering administration of such products together with STIVARGA."

The data described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS section reflect exposure to STIVARGA in more than 4800 patients who were enrolled in four randomized, placebo-controlled trials (n=1142), an expanded access program (CONSIGN, n=2864), or single arm clinical trials (single agent or in combination with other agents). There were 4518 patients who received STIVARGA as a single agent; the distribution of underlying malignancies was 80% CRC, 4% GIST, 10% HCC, 6% other solid tumors; and 74% were White, 11% Asian, and 15% race not known. Among these 4518 patients, 83% received STIVARGA for at least 21 days and 20% received STIVARGA for 6 months or longer. In randomized placebo-controlled trials (CORRECT, GRID, RESORCE and CONCUR), the most frequently observed adverse drug reactions (\u226520%) in patients receiving STIVARGA are pain (including gastrointestinal and abdominal pain), HFSR, asthenia/fatigue, diarrhea, decreased appetite/food intake, hypertension, infection, dysphonia, hyperbilirubinemia, fever, mucositis, weight loss, rash, and nausea. Colorectal Cancer The safety data described below, except where noted, are derived from a randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (CORRECT) in which 500 patients (median age 61 years; 61% men) with previously-treated metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) received STIVARGA as a single agent at the dose of 160 mg daily for the first 3 weeks of each 4 week treatment cycle and 253 patients (median age 61 years; 60% men) received placebo. The median duration of therapy was 1.7 months (range 2 days, 10.8 months) for patients receiving STIVARGA. Due to adverse reactions, 61% of the patients receiving STIVARGA required a dose interruption and 38% of the patients had their dose reduced. Adverse reactions that resulted in treatment discontinuation occurred in 8.2% of STIVARGA-treated patients compared to 1.2% of patients who received placebo. Hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) and rash were the most common reasons for permanent discontinuation of STIVARGA. Table 1 provides the incidence of adverse reactions (\u226510%) in patients in CORRECT.

Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors The safety data described below are derived from a randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (GRID) in which 132 patients (median age 60 years; 64% men) with previously-treated GIST received STIVARGA as a single agent at a dose of 160 mg daily for the first 3 weeks of each 4 week treatment cycle and 66 patients (median age 61 years; 64% men) received placebo. The median duration of therapy was 5.7 months (range 1 day, 11.7 months) for patients receiving STIVARGA. Dose interruptions for adverse events were required in 58% of patients receiving STIVARGA and 50% of patients had their dose reduced. Adverse reactions that resulted in treatment discontinuation were reported in 2.3% of STIVARGA-treated patients compared to 1.5% of patients who received placebo.

Hepatocellular Carcinoma The safety data described below are derived from a randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (RESORCE) in which patients with previously-treated HCC received either STIVARGA (n=374) 160 mg orally on days 1-21 of each 4 week treatment cycle or placebo (n=193). The median age was 63 years, 88% were men, 98% had Child-Pugh A cirrhosis, 66% had an ECOG performance status (PS) of 0 and 34% had PS of 1. The median duration of therapy was 3.5 months (range 1 day to 29.4 months) for patients receiving STIVARGA. Of the patients receiving STIVARGA, 33% were exposed to STIVARGA for greater than or equal to 6 months and 14% were exposed to STIVARGA for greater than or equal to 12 months. Dose interruptions for adverse events were required in 58.3% of patients receiving STIVARGA and 48% of patients had their dose reduced. The most common adverse reactions requiring dose modification (interruption or dose reduction) were HFSR/PPES (20.6%), blood bilirubin increase (5.9%), fatigue (5.1%) and diarrhea (5.3%). Adverse reactions that resulted in treatment discontinuation were reported in 10.4% of STIVARGA-treated patients compared to 3.6% of patients who received placebo; the most common adverse reactions requiring discontinuation of STIVARGA were HFSR/PPES (1.9%) and AST increased (1.6%). Table 5 provides the incidence of adverse reactions (\u226510%) in patients in RESORCE.

( 2.1 , 12.3 ) 2.1 Recommended Dose The recommended dose is 160 mg STIVARGA (four 40 mg tablets) taken orally once daily for the first 21 days of each 28-day cycle. Continue treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Take STIVARGA at the same time each day. Swallow tablet whole with water after a low-fat meal that contains less than 600 calories and less than 30% fat [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Do not take two doses of STIVARGA on the same day to make up for a missed dose from the previous day. 2.2 Dose Modifications If dose modifications are required, reduce the dose in 40 mg (one tablet) increments; the lowest recommended daily dose of STIVARGA is 80 mg daily. Interrupt STIVARGA for the following: \u2022 Grade 2 hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) [palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (PPES)] that is recurrent or does not improve within 7 days despite dose reduction; interrupt therapy for a minimum of 7 days for Grade 3 HFSR \u2022 Symptomatic Grade 2 hypertension \u2022 Any Grade 3 or 4 adverse reaction \u2022 Worsening infection of any grade Reduce the dose of STIVARGA to 120 mg: \u2022 For the first occurrence of Grade 2 HFSR of any duration \u2022 After recovery of any Grade 3 or 4 adverse reaction except infection \u2022 For Grade 3 aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation, only resume if the potential benefit outweighs the risk of hepatotoxicity Reduce the dose of STIVARGA to 80 mg: \u2022 For re-occurrence of Grade 2 HFSR at the 120 mg dose \u2022 After recovery of any Grade 3 or 4 adverse reaction at the 120 mg dose (except hepatotoxicity or infection) Discontinue STIVARGA permanently for the following: \u2022 Failure to tolerate 80 mg dose \u2022 Any occurrence of AST or ALT more than 20 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) \u2022 Any occurrence of AST or ALT more than 3 times ULN with concurrent bilirubin more than 2 times ULN \u2022 Re-occurrence of AST or ALT more than 5 times ULN despite dose reduction to 120 mg \u2022 For any Grade 4 adverse reaction; only resume if the potential benefit outweighs the risks"
