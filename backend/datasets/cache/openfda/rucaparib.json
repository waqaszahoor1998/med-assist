    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Effect of Rubraca on Other Drugs Certain CYP1A2, CYP3A, CYP2C9, or CYP2C19 Substrates Concomitant administration of Rubraca with CYP1A2, CYP3A, CYP2C9, or CYP2C19 substrates can increase the systemic exposure of these substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , which may increase the frequency or severity of adverse reactions of these substrates. If concomitant administration is unavoidable between Rubraca and substrates of these enzymes where minimal concentration changes may lead to serious adverse reactions, decrease the substrate dosage in accordance with the approved prescribing information. If concomitant administration with warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate) cannot be avoided, consider increasing the frequency of international normalized ratio (INR) monitoring."

    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Myelodysplastic Syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukemia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Most common adverse reactions (\u2265 10%) among patients with ovarian cancer were nausea, fatigue (including asthenia), anemia, AST/ALT increased, vomiting, diarrhea, decreased appetite, thrombocytopenia, dysgeusia, neutropenia, blood creatinine increased, dyspnea, dizziness, dyspepsia, photosensitivity reaction, and leukopenia. ( 6.1 ) Most common adverse reactions (\u2265 20%) among patients with BRCA -mutated mCRPC were fatigue (including asthenia), nausea, anemia, ALT/AST increased, decreased appetite, rash, constipation, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, diarrhea. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact pharmaand agent at 1-800-506-8501 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The pooled safety population for patients with ovarian cancer in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS section reflect exposure to Rubraca at 600 mg orally twice daily in 1594 patients treated on clinical trials including ARIEL3. In this group, 57% of patients were exposed for 6 months or longer and 33% were exposed for greater than one year. In the pooled safety population for patients with ovarian cancer, the most common adverse reactions in \u2265 10% of patients were nausea (68%), asthenia/fatigue (65%), anemia/hemoglobin decreased (45%), AST/ALT increased (39%), vomiting (36%), diarrhea (29%), decreased appetite (27%), thrombocytopenia/platelet count decreased (25%), dysgeusia (24%), neutropenia/neutrophil count decreased (21%), blood creatinine increased (17%), dyspnea (16%), dizziness (14%), dyspepsia (11%), photosensitivity reaction (10%), and leukopenia/white blood cell count decreased (10%). Maintenance Treatment of BRCA -mutated Recurrent Ovarian Cancer The safety of Rubraca for the maintenance treatment of patients with BRCA -mutated recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer was investigated in ARIEL3, a randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled study in which 195 patients with a deleterious BRCA mutation received either Rubraca 600 mg orally twice daily (n=129) or placebo (n=66) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The median duration of study treatment was 13.6 months (range: < 1 month to 39 months) for patients who received Rubraca and 5.5 months for patients who received placebo. Dose interruptions due to an adverse reaction of any grade occurred in 67% of patients receiving Rubraca and 14% of those receiving placebo; dose reductions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 57% of Rubraca patients and 6% of placebo patients. The most frequent adverse reactions leading to dose interruption or dose reduction of Rubraca were thrombocytopenia (25%), anemia (19%), AST/ALT increased (16%), fatigue/asthenia (14%), and nausea (10%). Discontinuation due to adverse reactions occurred in 15% of Rubraca patients and 5% of placebo patients. Specific adverse reactions that most frequently led to discontinuation in patients treated with Rubraca were thrombocytopenia (4%), nausea (3%), and anemia (2%). Table 2 describes the adverse reactions occurring in \u226520% of patients; while Table 3 describes the laboratory abnormalities occurring in \u226525% of patients occurring in ARIEL3. Table 2.

TRITON2 enrolled 209 patients with HRD-positive mCRPC, including 115 with BRCA -mutated mCRPC. Among the patients with BRCA -mutated mCRPC, the median duration of Rubraca treatment was 6.5 months (range 0.5 to 26.7). There were 2 (1.7%) patients with adverse reactions leading to death, one each attributed to acute respiratory distress syndrome and pneumonia. Dose interruptions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 57% of patients receiving Rubraca. Adverse reactions requiring dose interruption in >3% of patients included anemia, thrombocytopenia, asthenia/fatigue, nausea, vomiting, neutropenia, ALT/AST increased, creatinine increased, decreased appetite, acute kidney injury, and hypophosphatemia. Dose reductions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 41% of patients receiving Rubraca. Adverse reactions requiring dose reduction in >3% of patients were anemia (14%), asthenia/fatigue (10%), thrombocytopenia (7%), nausea (6%), decreased appetite (4%), and rash (3%). Discontinuation due to adverse reactions occurred in 8% of patients receiving Rubraca. None of the adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of Rubraca (ECG QT prolonged, acute respiratory distress syndrome, anemia, balance disorder, cardiac failure, decreased appetite/fatigue/weight decreased, leukopenia/neutropenia, ALT/AST increased, and pneumonia) occurred in more than one patient (<1%). Tables 4 and 5 summarize the adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities, respectively, in patients with BRCA-- mutated mCRPC in TRITON2. Table 4.
