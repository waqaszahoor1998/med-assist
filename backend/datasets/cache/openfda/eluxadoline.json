    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Tables 2 and 3 include drugs which demonstrated a clinically important drug interaction with VIBERZI or which potentially may result in clinically relevant interactions. Table 2: Established and Other Potentially Clinically Relevant Interactions Affecting VIBERZI OATP1B1 Inhibitors Clinical Impact: Increased exposure to eluxadoline when coadministered with cyclosporine [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] Intervention: Administer VIBERZI at a dose of 75 mg twice daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2 )] and monitor patients for impaired mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery and for other eluxadoline-related adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Examples: cyclosporine, gemfibrozil, antiretrovirals (atazanavir, lopinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, tipranavir), rifampin, eltrombopag Drugs that Cause Constipation Clinical Impact: Increased risk for constipation related adverse reactions and potential for constipation related serious adverse reactions Intervention: Avoid use with other drugs that may cause constipation (see below); loperamide may be used occasionally for acute management of severe diarrhea but avoid chronic use. Discontinue loperamide immediately if constipation occurs. Examples: alosetron, anticholinergics, opioids Table 3: Established and Other Potentially Clinically Relevant Interactions Affecting Drugs Co-Administered with VIBERZI OATP1B1 and BCRP Substrate Clinical Impact: VIBERZI may increase the exposure of co-administered OATP1B1 and BCRP substrates. Increased exposure to rosuvastatin when co-administered with VIBERZI with a potential for increased risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ] Intervention: Use the lowest effective dose of rosuvastatin (see prescribing information of rosuvastatin for additional information on recommended dosing). See full prescribing information for clinically relevant interactions. ( 7 )"

    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions described below and elsewhere in the labeling include: Pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Sphincter of Oddi Spasm [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Constipation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Most common adverse reactions (>5%) are constipation, nausea and abdominal pain. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact AbbVie at 1- 800-678-1605 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial s Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Over 1700 patients with IBS-D have been treated with 75 or 100 mg of VIBERZI twice daily in controlled trials. Exposures from placebo-controlled clinical trials in adult patients with IBS-D included 1391 exposed for 3 months, 1001 exposed for 6 months and 488 exposed for one year. Demographic characteristics were comparable between the treatment groups [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . Data described below represent pooled data compared to placebo across the randomized trials. Pancreatitis Cases of pancreatitis, not associated with sphincter of Oddi spasm, were reported in 2/807 (0.2%) of patients receiving 75 mg and 3/1032 (0.3%) of patients receiving 100 mg VIBERZI twice daily in clinical trials. Of these 5 cases, 3 were associated with excessive alcohol intake, one was associated with biliary sludge, and in one case the patient discontinued VIBERZI 2 weeks prior to the onset of symptoms. All pancreatic events resolved with lipase normalization upon discontinuation of VIBERZI, with 80% (4/5) resolving within 1 week of treatment discontinuation. The case of sphincter of Oddi spasm-induced pancreatitis resolved within 24 hours of discontinuation. Sp h incter of Oddi Spasm In clinical trials, sphincter of Oddi spasm occurred in 0.2% (2/807) of patients receiving 75 mg and 0.8% (8/1032) of patients receiving 100 mg VIBERZI twice daily. Among patients receiving 75 mg, 1/807 (0.1%) patient experienced a sphincter of Oddi spasm presenting with abdominal pain but with lipase elevation less than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) and 1/ 807 (0.1%) patient experienced a sphincter of Oddi spasm manifested as elevated hepatic enzymes associated with abdominal pain Among patients receiving 100 mg, 1/1032 (0.1%) patient experienced a sphincter of Oddi spasm manifested as pancreatitis and 7/1032 (0.7%) patients experienced sphincter of Oddi spasm manifested as elevated hepatic enzymes associated with abdominal pain Of those patients who experienced a sphincter of Oddi spasm, 80% (8/10) reported their first onset of symptoms within the first week of treatment. The case of sphincter of Oddi spasm-induced pancreatitis occurred within minutes of taking the first dose of VIBERZI. No cases of sphincter of Oddi spasm occurred greater than 1 month after treatment onset. All events resolved upon discontinuation of VIBERZI, with symptoms typically improved by the following day. Common Adverse Reactions Table 1 provides the incidence of common adverse reactions reported in > 2% of IBS-D patients in either VIBERZI treatment group and at an incidence greater than in the placebo group.

Approximately 50% of constipation events occurred within the first 2 weeks of treatment while the majority occurred within the first 3 months of therapy. Rates of severe constipation were less than 1% in patients receiving 75 mg and 100 mg VIBERZI. Similar rates of constipation occurred between the active and placebo arms beyond 3 months of treatment. Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation Eight percent of patients treated with 75 mg, 8% of patients treated with 100 mg VIBERZI and 4% of patients treated with placebo discontinued prematurely due to adverse reactions. In the VIBERZI treatment groups, the most common reasons for discontinuation due to adverse reactions were constipation (1% for 75 mg and 2% for 100 mg) and abdominal pain (1% for both 75 mg and 100 mg). In comparison, less than 1% of patients in the placebo group withdrew due to constipation or abdominal pain. Less Common Adverse Reactions Adverse reactions that were reported in \u2264 2% of VIBERZI-treated patients are listed below by body system. Gastrointestinal : gastroesophageal reflux disease General Disorders and administration site conditions : feeling drunk Investigations: increased AST Nervous system : sedation, somnolence Psychiatric disorders : euphoric mood Respiratory : asthma, bronchospasm, respiratory failure, wheezing 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of VIBERZI. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity : anaphylaxis, angioedema (e.g. swollen face and throat), dyspnea, throat tightness, and chest pain/tightness [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] ."
