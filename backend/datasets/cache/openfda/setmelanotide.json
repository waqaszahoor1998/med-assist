    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Disturbance in Sexual Arousal [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Depression and Suicidal Ideation [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Skin Hyperpigmentation, Darkening of Pre-Existing Nevi, and Development of New Melanocytic Nevi [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Most common adverse reactions (incidence \u226520%) included skin hyperpigmentation, injection site reactions, nausea, headache, diarrhea, abdominal pain, vomiting, depression, and spontaneous penile erection. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Rhythm Pharmaceuticals at 1-833-789-6337 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (Adults and Pediatric Patients Aged 6 Years and Older) The safety of IMCIVREE was evaluated in a clinical study, which included a 14 week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled period followed by a 52-week open-label, treatment period, in 44 patients aged 6 years and older with obesity and a clinical diagnosis of BBS (Study 1) [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. The study duration was 66 weeks. During the 14-week placebo-controlled period in Study 1, the most common reported adverse reactions in IMCIVREE-treated patients when compared to placebo-treated patients were hyperpigmentation disorders (67% vs 0%, respectively) and vomiting (11% vs 0%, respectively). Adverse reactions were also evaluated during the 52-week active-treatment period, defined as the period from randomization to Week 52 in patients initially randomized to IMCIVREE, and from Week 14 to Week 66 in patients initially randomized to placebo. Table 3 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred in 2 or more IMCIVREE-treated patients in Study 3 during the 52-week active treatment period. Table 3: Adverse Reactions Occurring in 2 or More IMCIVREE-Treated Patients with Obesity and a Clinical Diagnosis of BBS During the 52-week Active-Treatment Period from the Start of IMCIVREE Treatment (Study 1) 1 43 patients were treated with at least 1 dose of IMCIVREE; 1 patient initially randomized to placebo withdrew from the study prior to receiving IMCIVREE and is not included 2 Includes skin hyperpigmentation, hair color changes, melanoderma 3 Includes injection site erythema, pruritis, induration, pain, bruising, edema, reaction, hemorrhage, irritation, mass 4 n = 20 male patients 5 Includes new melanocytic nevus formation, increased melanocytic nevus size, and darkening of pre-existing melanocytic nevus Adverse Reaction IMCIVREE-treated Patients N = 43 1 % Skin hyperpigmentation 2 63 Injection Site Reactions 3 51 Nausea 26 Spontaneous penile erection 4 25 Vomiting 19 Diarrhea 14 Melanocytic nevus 5 14 Headache 7 Skin striae 7 Aggression 5 Fatigue 5 POMC, PCSK1, and LEPR Deficiency (Adults and Pediatric Patients Aged 6 Years and Older) The safety of IMCIVREE was evaluated in two 52-week, open-label clinical studies of 27 patients aged 6 years and older with obesity due to POMC, PCSK1, or LEPR deficiency with POMC, PCSK1, or LEPR genes that are interpreted as pathogenic, likely pathogenic, or of uncertain significance (Study 2 and Study 3) [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . Table 4 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred in the open-label studies during the first 52 weeks of treatment in 3 or more patients treated with IMCIVREE.

No patients with PCSK1 were enrolled in the trial. Table 5 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred in the open-label study during 52 weeks of treatment in 3 or more patients treated with IMCIVREE.

Instruct patients to use a 1-mL syringe with a 28-gauge or 29-gauge needle appropriate for subcutaneous injection. Remove IMCIVREE from the refrigerator approximately 15 minutes prior to administration. Alternatively, warm IMCIVREE prior to administration by rolling the vial gently between the palms of the hands for 60 seconds. Inspect IMCIVREE visually before use. It should appear clear to slightly opalescent, colorless to slightly yellow. Do not use if particulate matter or discoloration is seen. Administer IMCIVREE once daily, at the beginning of the day, without regard to meals. Inject IMCIVREE subcutaneously in the abdomen, thigh, or arm, rotating to a different site each day. Do not administer IMCIVREE intravenously or intramuscularly. If a dose is missed, resume the once daily regimen as prescribed with the next scheduled dose."
