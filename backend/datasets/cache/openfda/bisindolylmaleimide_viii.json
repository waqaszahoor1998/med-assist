    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See also Contraindications (4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) . If LEXIVA is used in combination with ritonavir, see full prescribing information for ritonavir for additional information on drug interactions. Coadministration of LEXIVA with drugs that induce CYP3A4 may decrease amprenavir (active metabolite) concentrations leading to potential loss of virologic activity. (7, 12.3) Coadministration with drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 may increase amprenavir concentrations. (7, 12.3) Coadministration of LEXIVA and ritonavir may result in clinically significant interactions with drugs metabolized by CYP2D6. (7) 7.1 CYP Inhibitors and Inducers Amprenavir, the active metabolite of fosamprenavir, is an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4 metabolism and therefore should not be administered concurrently with medications with narrow therapeutic windows that are substrates of CYP3A4. Data also suggest that amprenavir induces CYP3A4. Amprenavir is metabolized by CYP3A4. Coadministration of LEXIVA and drugs that induce CYP3A4, such as rifampin, may decrease amprenavir concentrations and reduce its therapeutic effect. Coadministration of LEXIVA and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 may increase amprenavir concentrations and increase the incidence of adverse effects. The potential for drug interactions with LEXIVA changes when LEXIVA is coadministered with the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ritonavir. The magnitude of CYP3A4-mediated drug interactions (effect on amprenavir or effect on coadministered drug) may change when LEXIVA is coadministered with ritonavir. Because ritonavir is a CYP2D6 inhibitor, clinically significant interactions with drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 are possible when coadministered with LEXIVA plus ritonavir. There are other agents that may result in serious and/or life-threatening drug interactions [see Contraindications (4)] . 7.2 Drugs That Should Not Be Coadministered With LEXIVA See Contraindications (4). 7.3 Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions Table 6 provides a listing of established or potentially clinically significant drug interactions. Information in the table applies to LEXIVA with or without ritonavir, unless otherwise indicated. Table 6. Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions Concomitant Drug Class: Drug Name Effect on Concentration of Amprenavir or Concomitant Drug Clinical Comment HIV-Antiviral Agents Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor: Efavirenz a LEXIVA: \u2193Amprenavir LEXIVA/ritonavir: \u2193Amprenavir Appropriate doses of the combinations with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established. An additional 100 mg/day (300 mg total) of ritonavir is recommended when efavirenz is administered with LEXIVA/ritonavir once daily. No change in the ritonavir dose is required when efavirenz is administered with LEXIVA plus ritonavir twice daily. Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor: Nevirapine a LEXIVA: \u2193Amprenavir \u2191Nevirapine LEXIVA/ritonavir: \u2193Amprenavir \u2191Nevirapine Coadministration of nevirapine and LEXIVA without ritonavir is not recommended.

Other Agents Antiarrhythmics: Amiodarone, bepridil, lidocaine (systemic), and quinidine \u2191Antiarrhythmics Use with caution. Increased exposure may be associated with life-threatening reactions such as cardiac arrhythmias. Therapeutic concentration monitoring, if available, is recommended for antiarrhythmics. Anticoagulant: Warfarin Concentrations of warfarin may be affected. It is recommended that INR (international normalized ratio) be monitored. Anticonvulsants: Carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin Phenytoin a LEXIVA: \u2193Amprenavir LEXIVA/ritonavir: \u2191Amprenavir \u2193Phenytoin Use with caution. LEXIVA may be less effective due to decreased amprenavir plasma concentrations in patients taking these agents concomitantly. Plasma phenytoin concentrations should be monitored and phenytoin dose should be increased as appropriate. No change in LEXIVA/ritonavir dose is recommended. Antidepressant: Paroxetine, trazodone \u2193Paroxetine \u2191Trazodone Coadministration of paroxetine with LEXIVA/ritonavir significantly decreased plasma levels of paroxetine. Any paroxetine dose adjustment should be guided by clinical effect (tolerability and efficacy). Concomitant use of trazodone and LEXIVA with or without ritonavir may increase plasma concentrations of trazodone. Adverse events of nausea, dizziness, hypotension, and syncope have been observed following coadministration of trazodone and ritonavir. If trazodone is used with a CYP3A4 inhibitor such as LEXIVA, the combination should be used with caution and a lower dose of trazodone should be considered. Antifungals: Ketoconazole a , itraconazole \u2191Ketoconazole \u2191Itraconazole Increase monitoring for adverse events. LEXIVA: Dose reduction of ketoconazole or itraconazole may be needed for patients receiving more than 400 mg ketoconazole or itraconazole per day. LEXIVA/ritonavir: High doses of ketoconazole or itraconazole (>200 mg/day) are not recommended. Antimycobacterial: Rifabutin a \u2191Rifabutin and rifabutin metabolite A complete blood count should be performed weekly and as clinically indicated to monitor for neutropenia. LEXIVA: A dosage reduction of rifabutin by at least half the recommended dose is required. LEXIVA/ritonavir: Dosage reduction of rifabutin by at least 75% of the usual dose of 300 mg/day is recommended (a maximum dose of 150 mg every other day or 3 times per week). Benzodiazepines: Alprazolam, clorazepate, diazepam, flurazepam \u2191Benzodiazepines Clinical significance is unknown. A decrease in benzodiazepine dose may be needed. Calcium channel blockers: Diltiazem, felodipine, nifedipine, nicardipine, nimodipine, verapamil, amlodipine, nisoldipine, isradipine \u2191Calcium channel blockers Use with caution. Clinical monitoring of patients is recommended. Corticosteroid: Dexamethasone \u2193Amprenavir Use with caution. LEXIVA may be less effective due to decreased amprenavir plasma concentrations. Histamine H 2 -receptor antagonists: Cimetidine, famotidine, nizatidine, ranitidine a LEXIVA: \u2193Amprenavir LEXIVA/ritonavir: Interaction not evaluated Use with caution. LEXIVA may be less effective due to decreased amprenavir plasma concentrations. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor: Atorvastatin a , rosuvastatin \u2191Atorvastatin \u2191Rosuvastatin Use the lowest possible dose of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin with careful monitoring, or consider other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as fluvastatin or pravastatin. Immunosuppressants: Cyclosporine, tacrolimus, rapamycin \u2191Immunosuppressants Therapeutic concentration monitoring is recommended for immunosuppressant agents. Inhaled/nasal steroid: Fluticasone LEXIVA: \u2191Fluticasone LEXIVA/ritonavir: \u2191Fluticasone Use with caution. Consider alternatives to fluticasone, particularly for long-term use. May result in significantly reduced serum cortisol concentrations. Systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushings syndrome and adrenal suppression have been reported during postmarketing use in patients receiving ritonavir and inhaled or intranasally administered fluticasone. Coadministration of fluticasone and LEXIVA/ritonavir is not recommended unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid side effects. Narcotic analgesic: Methadone \u2193Methadone Data suggest that the interaction is not clinically relevant; however, patients should be monitored for opiate withdrawal symptoms. Oral contraceptives: Ethinyl estradiol/norethin-drone a LEXIVA: \u2193Amprenavir \u2193Ethinyl estradiol LEXIVA/ritonavir: \u2193Ethinyl estradiol Alternative methods of non-hormonal contraception are recommended. May lead to loss of virologic response. * Increased risk of transaminase elevations. No data are available on the use of LEXIVA/ritonavir with other hormonal therapies, such as hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for postmenopausal women. PDE5 inhibitors: Sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil \u2191Sildenafil \u2191Tadalafil \u2191Vardenafil May result in an increase in PDE5 inhibitor-associated adverse events, including hypotension, visual changes, and priapism.

    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Severe or life-threatening skin reactions have been reported with the use of LEXIVA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. The most common moderate to severe adverse reactions in clinical studies of LEXIVA were diarrhea, rash, nausea, vomiting, and headache. Treatment discontinuation due to adverse events occurred in 6.4% of patients receiving LEXIVA and in 5.9% of patients receiving comparator treatments. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of LEXIVA (incidence \u22641% of patients) included diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, AST increased, ALT increased, and rash. In adults the most common adverse reactions (incidence \u22654%) are diarrhea, rash, nausea, vomiting, headache. (6.1) Vomiting was more frequent in pediatrics than in adults. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact GlaxoSmithKline at 1-888-825-5249 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Adults The data for the 3 active-controlled clinical trials described below reflect exposure of 700 HIV-1 infected patients to LEXIVA Tablets, including 599 patients exposed to LEXIVA for >24 weeks, and 409 patients exposed for >48 weeks. The population age ranged from 17 to 72 years. Of these patients, 26% were female, 51% Caucasian, 31% black, 16% American Hispanic, and 70% were antiretroviral-naive. Sixty-one percent received LEXIVA 1,400 mg once daily plus ritonavir 200 mg once daily, 24% received LEXIVA 1,400 mg twice daily, and 15% received LEXIVA 700 mg twice daily plus ritonavir 100 mg twice daily. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Selected adverse reactions reported during the clinical efficacy studies of LEXIVA are shown in Tables 2 and 3. Each table presents adverse reactions of moderate or severe intensity in patients treated with combination therapy for up to 48 weeks. Table 2.

Skin rash (without regard to causality) occurred in approximately 19% of patients treated with LEXIVA in the pivotal efficacy studies. Rashes were usually maculopapular and of mild or moderate intensity, some with pruritus. Rash had a median onset of 11 days after initiation of LEXIVA and had a median duration of 13 days. Skin rash led to discontinuation of LEXIVA in <1% of patients. In some patients with mild or moderate rash, dosing with LEXIVA was often continued without interruption; if interrupted, reintroduction of LEXIVA generally did not result in rash recurrence. The percentages of patients with Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities in the clinical efficacy studies of LEXIVA are presented in Tables 4 and 5. Table 4.

Safety information from 75 pediatric patients receiving LEXIVA twice daily with or without ritonavir follows. All adverse events regardless of causality, all drug-related adverse events, and all laboratory events occurred with similar frequency in pediatrics compared with adults, with the exception of vomiting. Vomiting, regardless of causality, occurred more frequently among pediatric patients receiving LEXIVA twice daily with ritonavir ([30%] all between 2 and 18 years of age) and without ritonavir ([56%] all between 2 and 5 years of age) compared with adults receiving LEXIVA twice daily with ritonavir (10%) and without ritonavir (16%). The median duration of drug-related vomiting episodes was 1 day (range: 1 to 62 days). Vomiting required temporary dose interruptions in 4 pediatric patients and was treatment-limiting in 1 pediatric patient, all of whom were receiving LEXIVA twice daily with ritonavir. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials, the following reactions have been identified during post-approval use of LEXIVA. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to LEXIVA. Cardiac Disorders Myocardial infarction. Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders Hypercholesterolemia. Nervous System Disorders Oral paresthesia. Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Angioedema. Urogenital Nephrolithiasis."
