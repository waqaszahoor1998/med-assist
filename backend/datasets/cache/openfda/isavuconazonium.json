    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Isavuconazole is a sensitive substrate of CYP3A4. CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers may alter the plasma concentrations of isavuconazole. Isavuconazole is a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4, and a mild inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), and organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2). Drug interaction studies were conducted to investigate the effect of coadministered drugs on the pharmacokinetics of isavuconazole and the effect of isavuconazole on the pharmacokinetics of coadministered drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Table 4. Drug(s) Affecting Pharmacokinetics of CRESEMBA Recommendation Comments Ketoconazole Contraindicate coadministration of all potent CYP3A4 inhibitors There is more than a 5-fold increase in exposure of isavuconazole upon coadministration with ketoconazole [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Lopinavir/ritonavir 400 mg of lopinavir in combination with 100 mg of ritonavir. Caution is advised when CRESEMBA is coadministered with lopinavir/ritonavir There is a 96% increase in exposure of isavuconazole when coadministered with lopinavir/ritonavir [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Rifampin Contraindicate coadministration of all potent CYP3A4 inducers There is a 97% decrease in exposure of isavuconazole upon coadministration with rifampin [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Table 5. The Effect of CRESEMBA on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Drugs Recommendation Comments Lopinavir/ritonavir 400 mg of lopinavir in combination with 100 mg of ritonavir. Use with Caution Concomitant administration of lopinavir/ritonavir and CRESEMBA resulted in decreased exposure of lopinavir and ritonavir that could possibly result in loss of antiviral efficacy [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Atorvastatin Use with Caution Caution should be used when atorvastatin is used with CRESEMBA due to a potential increase in atorvastatin exposure. Monitor patients for adverse reactions that are typical of atorvastatin [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Cyclosporine Use with Caution Concomitant administration of CRESEMBA and cyclosporine results in increase in cyclosporine exposure. Monitor drug concentrations of cyclosporine and adjust dose as needed [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Sirolimus Use with Caution Concomitant administration of CRESEMBA and sirolimus results in increase in sirolimus exposure. Monitor drug concentrations of sirolimus and adjust dose as needed [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Tacrolimus Use with Caution Concomitant administration of CRESEMBA and tacrolimus results in increase in tacrolimus exposure. Monitor drug concentrations of tacrolimus and adjust dose as needed [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Midazolam Use with Caution Concomitant administration of CRESEMBA and midazolam results in increase in midazolam exposure. Consider dose reduction of midazolam when isavuconazole is coadministered [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Bupropion Use with Caution Concomitant administration of CRESEMBA and bupropion results in decrease in bupropion exposure. Dose increase of bupropion may be necessary when coadministered with CRESEMBA, but should not exceed the maximum recommended dose [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Mycophenolate Mofetil Use with Caution Concomitant administration of CRESEMBA and MMF results in increase in MMF exposure. Patients receiving CRESEMBA concurrently with MMF should be monitored for MPA-related toxicities [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Digoxin Use with Caution Concomitant administration of CRESEMBA and digoxin results in increase in digoxin exposure. Serum digoxin concentrations should be monitored and used for titration when dosed concurrently with CRESEMBA [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Vincristine Avoid Concomitant Use Avoid concomitant use with CRESEMBA in pediatric and adult patients. CRESEMBA is predicted to have a less than 2\u2011fold increase in vincristine exposure in pediatric and adult patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )], which may increase the risk of vincristine-related adverse reactions. \u2022 CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers may alter the plasma concentrations of isavuconazole. ( 7 ) \u2022 Appropriate therapeutic drug monitoring and dose adjustment of immunosuppressants (i.e., tacrolimus, sirolimus, and cyclosporine) may be necessary when coadministered with CRESEMBA. ( 7 ) \u2022 Drugs with a narrow therapeutic window that are P-gp substrates, such as digoxin, may require dose adjustment when administered concomitantly with CRESEMBA. ( 7 )"

( 6.1 ) \u2022 Pediatric Patients: The most frequent adverse reactions in pediatric patients were diarrhea, abdominal pain, vomiting, elevated liver chemistry tests, rash, nausea, pruritus, and headache. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Astellas Pharma US, Inc. at 1-800-727-7003 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of CRESEMBA cannot be directly compared to rates in clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Clinical Trials Experience in Adult Patients A total of 403 adult patients were exposed to CRESEMBA in two clinical trials. The most frequently reported adverse reactions among CRESEMBA-treated patients were nausea (26%), vomiting (25%), diarrhea (22%), headache (17%), elevated liver chemistry tests (16%), hypokalemia (14%), constipation (13%), dyspnea (12%), cough (12%), peripheral edema (11%), and back pain (10%). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 223/403 (55%) of patients and 56/403 (14%) of patients permanently discontinued treatment with CRESEMBA due to an adverse reaction in the two trials. The adverse reactions which most often led to permanent discontinuation of CRESEMBA therapy during the clinical trials were confusional state (0.7%), acute renal failure (0.7%), increased blood bilirubin (0.5%), convulsion (0.5%), dyspnea (0.5%), epilepsy (0.5%), respiratory failure (0.5%), and vomiting (0.5%). Patients in the clinical trials were immunocompromised with underlying conditions including hematological malignancy, neutropenia post-chemotherapy, graft-versus-host disease, and hematopoietic stem cell transplant. The patient population was 61% male, had a mean age of 51 years (range 17-92, including 85 patients aged greater than 65 years), and was 79% White and 3% Black. One hundred forty-four (144) patients had a duration of CRESEMBA therapy of greater than 12 weeks, with 52 patients receiving CRESEMBA for over six months. In Trial 1, a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled clinical trial for treatment of invasive aspergillosis, treatment\u2011emergent adverse reactions occurred in 247/257 (96%), and 255/259 (99%) patients in the CRESEMBA and voriconazole treatment groups, respectively. Adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation were reported in 37 (14%) CRESEMBA-treated patients and 59 (23%) voriconazole-treated patients. Table 3 includes selected adverse reactions which were reported at an incidence of \u2265 5% during CRESEMBA therapy in Trial 1. In Trial 2, an open-label, non-comparative trial of CRESEMBA in patients with invasive aspergillosis and renal impairment or invasive mucormycosis, adverse reactions occurred in 139/146 (95%) of patients in the CRESEMBA treatment group. Adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation were reported in 19 (13%) CRESEMBA\u2011treated patients. The frequencies and types of adverse reactions observed in CRESEMBA-treated patients were similar between Trial 1 and Trial 2. Table 3.

Elevations of liver transaminases greater than ten times the upper limit of normal developed in 1.2% of patients who received CRESEMBA. Clinical Trials Experience in Pediatric Patients The clinical safety of CRESEMBA was assessed in 77 pediatric patients who received at least one dose of intravenous or oral CRESEMBA in two uncontrolled studies. Fifteen (19.5%) subjects were in the 1 to < 6 years old cohort, 30 subjects (39.0%) were in the 6 to < 12 years old cohort, and 32 subjects (41.6%) were in the 12 to < 18 years old cohort. The duration of treatment ranged from 1 to 181 days with a median duration of treatment of 15 days. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were diarrhea (26%), abdominal pain (23%), vomiting (21%), elevated liver chemistry tests (18%), rash (14%), nausea (13%), pruritus (13%) and headache (12%). In general, adverse reactions (including serious adverse reactions and adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation of CRESEMBA) were similar to those reported in adults. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of CRESEMBA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate the frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

CRESEMBA is water soluble, preservative-free, sterile, and nonpyrogenic. \u2022 Reconstitute one vial of CRESEMBA by adding 5 mL water for injection, USP to the vial. The resultant solution will be 74.4 mg/mL of isavuconazonium sulfate. \u2022 Gently shake to dissolve the powder completely. \u2022 Visually inspect the reconstituted solution for particulate matter and discoloration. Reconstituted CRESEMBA should be clear and free of visible particulate. \u2022 The reconstituted solution may be stored between 5\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C (41\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F) for a maximum of 1 hour prior to preparation of the patient intravenous infusion solution [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]. \u2022 For nasogastric tube administration, the reconstituted solution should be administered within 1 hour of reconstitution [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )]. \u2022 Discard any unused portion of the reconstituted solution. 2.5 Dilution and Preparation Instructions for the Intravenous Administration of the CRESEMBA for Injection Formulation \u2022 Based on the adult or pediatric dosage regimen [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 and 2.3 )], remove the appropriate volume of the reconstituted solution (74.4 mg/mL of isavuconazonium sulfate) from the vial and add it to an infusion bag containing 250 mL of compatible diluent [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 )] . A smaller volume infusion bag of compatible diluent may be used as long as the final concentration does not exceed approximately 1.5 mg isavuconazonium sulfate per mL. \u2022 The diluted solution may show visible translucent to white particulates of isavuconazole (which will be removed by in-line filtration). \u2022 Use gentle mixing or roll bag to minimize the formation of particulates. Avoid unnecessary vibration or vigorous shaking of the solution. \u2022 Apply in-line filter with a microporous membrane pore size of 0.2 to 1.2 micron and in-line filter reminder sticker to the infusion bag. \u2022 Do not use a pneumatic transport system. \u2022 The intravenous administration should be completed within 6 hours of dilution at room temperature. If this is not possible, immediately refrigerate (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C / 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) the infusion solution after dilution and complete the infusion within 24 hours. Do not freeze the infusion solution. 2.6 Preparation Instructions for the Nasogastric Tube Administration of the CRESEMBA for Injection Formulation CRESEMBA for injection can be administered through a nasogastric tube as follows: \u2022 Utilizing aseptic technique, reconstitute one vial of CRESEMBA for injection (equivalent to 200 mg isavuconazole) with 5 mL of water for injection, USP [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . \u2022 Based on the adult or pediatric (6 years of age to less than 18 years of age) CRESEMBA for injection dosage regimen [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.3 )] , withdraw the appropriate volume of the reconstituted solution (74.4 mg/mL of isavuconazonium sulfate) from the vial using an appropriate syringe and needle. Discard the needle and cap the syringe. \u2022 To administer, remove the cap from the syringe containing the reconstituted solution and connect the syringe to the nasogastric (NG) tube to deliver the dose. After administering the dose, administer three 5 mL rinses to the NG tube with water [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . \u2022 Administer the reconstituted solution via the nasogastric tube within 1 hour of reconstitution. Discard any unused portion of the reconstituted solution. \u2022 Do not administer CRESEMBA capsules through a nasogastric tube. 2.7 Compatibility for the Injection Formulation CRESEMBA for injection should only be administered with the following diluents: \u2022 0.9% sodium chloride injection, USP \u2022 5% dextrose injection, USP"
