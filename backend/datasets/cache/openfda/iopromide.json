    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Drug-Drug Interactions Metformin In patients with renal impairment, biguanides can cause lactic acidosis. Iodinated contrast agents appear to increase the risk of metformin-induced lactic acidosis, possibly as a result of worsening renal function. Stop metformin at the time of, or prior to, ULTRAVIST administration in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism, or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast agents. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure and reinstitute only after renal function is stable. Radioactive Iodine ULTRAVIST may interfere with thyroid uptake of radioactive iodine (I-131 and I-123) and decrease therapeutic and diagnostic efficacy. Avoid thyroid therapy or testing for up to 6 weeks post ULTRAVIST. 7.2 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions Protein-Bound Iodine Test Iodinated contrast agents, including ULTRAVIST, will temporarily increase protein-bound iodine in blood. Do not perform protein-bound iodine test for at least 16 days following administration of ULTRAVIST. However, thyroid function tests which do not depend on iodine estimations, for example, T 3 resin uptake and total or free thyroxine (T 4 ) assays are not affected."

The common adverse reactions reported in >1% of patients in clinical studies with ULTRAVIST are shown in Table 4. Table 4: Adverse Reactions Reported in >1% of Patients Receiving ULTRAVIST in Clinical Trials System Organ Class Adverse Reaction ULTRAVIST N=1,142 (%) Nervous system disorders Headache 46 (4) Dysgeusia 15 (1.3) Eye disorders Abnormal Vision 12 (1.1) Cardiac disorders Chest pain 18 (1.6) Vascular disorders Vasodilatation 30 (2.6) Gastrointestinal disorders Nausea 42 (3.7) Vomiting 22 (1.9) Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders Back pain 22 (1.9) Renal and urinary disorders Urinary urgency 21 (1.8) General disorders and administration site conditions Injection site and infusion site reactions (hemorrhage, hematoma, pain, edema, erythema, rash) 41 (3.7) Pain 13 (1.4) One or more adverse reactions were recorded in 273 of 1,142 (24%) patients during the clinical trials, coincident with the administration of ULTRAVIST or within the defined duration of the study follow-up period (24\u201372 hours). ULTRAVIST is often associated with sensations of warmth and/or pain. Serious, life-threatening, and fatal reactions have been associated with the administration of iodine-containing contrast media, including ULTRAVIST. In clinical trials 7 of 1,142 patients given ULTRAVIST died 5 days or later after drug administration. Also, 10 of 1,142 patients given ULTRAVIST had serious adverse events. The following adverse reactions were observed in \u22641% of the patients receiving ULTRAVIST: Cardiac disorders: atrioventricular block (complete), bradycardia, ventricular extrasystole Gastrointestinal disorders: abdominal discomfort, abdominal pain, abdominal pain upper, constipation, diarrhea, dry mouth, dyspepsia, gastrointestinal disorder, gastrointestinal pain, salivation increased, stomach discomfort, rectal tenesmus General disorders and administration site conditions: asthenia, chest discomfort, chills, excessive thirst, extravasation, feeling hot, hyperhidrosis, malaise, edema peripheral, pyrexia Immune system disorders: asthma, face edema Investigations: blood lactate dehydrogenase increased, blood urea increased, hemoglobin increased, white blood cell count increased Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: arthralgia, musculoskeletal pain, myasthenia, neck pain, pain in extremity Nervous system disorders: agitation, confusion, convulsion, dizziness, hypertonia, hypesthesia, incoordination, neuropathy, somnolence, speech disorder, tremor, paresthesia, visual field defect Psychiatric disorders: anxiety Renal and urinary disorders: dysuria, renal pain, urinary retention Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: apnea, cough increased, dyspnea, hypoxia, pharyngeal edema, pharyngitis, pleural effusion, pulmonary hypertension, respiratory disorder, sore throat Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: erythema, pruritus, rash, urticaria Vascular disorders: coronary artery thrombosis, flushing, hypertension, hypotension, peripheral vascular disorder, syncope, vascular anomaly Pediatric Patients A total of 274 pediatric patients were evaluated with intra-arterial coronary angiography (n=60), intravenous contrast computerized tomography (CT) (n=87), excretory urography (n=99), and 28 other procedures. These patients received 1 mL/kg to 2 mL/kg body weight of a concentration of 300 mg Iodine per mL for intravenous contrast CT or excretory urography and 370 mg Iodine per mL for intra-arterial and intracardiac administration in the radiographic evaluation of the heart cavities and major arteries [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )]. Among these, 131 were 2 to 12 years old, 57 were adolescents, and 86 were unreported or other ages. There were 148 females, 94 males, and 32 in whom gender was not reported. The racial distribution was: White 33.9%, Black 0.4%, Asian 2.2%, and unknown 63.5%. The overall character, quality, and severity of adverse reactions in pediatric patients are generally similar to those reported in adult patients. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of ULTRAVIST. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Adverse reactions reported in foreign postmarketing surveillance and other trials with the use of ULTRAVIST include: Cardiac disorders: cardiac arrest, ventricular fibrillation, atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, palpitations, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris Ear and labyrinth disorders: vertigo, tinnitus Endocrine disorders: hyperthyroidism, thyrotoxic crisis, hypothyroidism Eye disorders: mydriasis, lacrimation disorder Gastrointestinal disorders: dysphagia, swelling of salivary glands Immune system disorders: anaphylactoid reaction (including fatal cases), respiratory arrest, anaphylactoid shock, angioedema, laryngeal edema, laryngospasm, bronchospasm, hypersensitivity Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: compartment syndrome in case of extravasation Nervous system disorders: cerebral ischemia/infarction, paralysis, paresis, transient cortical blindness, aphasia, coma, unconsciousness, amnesia, hypotonia, aggravation of myasthenia gravis symptoms Renal and urinary disorders: renal failure, hematuria Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome, asthma Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Reactions range from mild (e.g., rash, erythema, pruritus, urticaria and skin discoloration) to severe [e.g., Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS)]. Vascular disorders: vasospasm Pediatric Patients Additional adverse reactions reported in pediatric patients from foreign marketing surveillance or other information include: epistaxis, migraine, joint disorder (effusion), muscle cramps, mucous membrane disorder (mucosal swelling), conjunctivitis, fixed eruptions, diabetes insipidus, and brain edema. 6.3 Pediatrics The overall character, quality, and severity of adverse reactions in pediatric patients are generally similar to those reported in adult patients.
