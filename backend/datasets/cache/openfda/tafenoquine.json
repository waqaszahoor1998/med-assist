    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Avoid co-administration with drugs that are substrates of organic cation transporter-2 (OCT2) or multidrug and toxin extrusion (MATE) transporters ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Effect of ARAKODA on Organic Cation Transporter-2 (OCT2) and Multidrug and Toxin Extrusion (MATE) Substrates The effect of coadministration of tafenoquine on the pharmacokinetics of OCT2 and MATE substrates in humans is unknown. However, in vitro observations suggest the potential for increased concentrations of these substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] which may increase the risk of toxicity of these drugs. Avoid coadministration of ARAKODA with OCT2 and MATE substrates (e.g., dofetilide, metformin). If coadministration cannot be avoided, monitor for drug-related toxicities and consider dosage reduction if needed based on approved product labeling of the coadministered drug."

( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact 60 Degrees Pharmaceuticals at 1-888-834-0225 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of tafenoquine was studied in clinical trials at various doses and regimens in 3,184 subjects. The recommended ARAKODA regimen was evaluated in 825 subjects in 5 controlled clinical trials (Trials 1, Trial 2, Trial 3, Trial 4 and Trial 5). The mean duration of exposure to ARAKODA in these five clinical trials was 21 weeks (range 10-29 weeks). Trial 1, 2 and 4 were conducted in healthy semi-immune volunteers in Ghana or Kenya and were placebo-controlled; a mefloquine arm was included in Trials 2 and 4 as a benchmark. Trial 3, an active comparator (mefloquine) controlled trial was conducted in healthy soldiers deployed in East Timor (Timor Leste). A placebo-controlled Trial 5 was conducted in healthy volunteers in the United States and United Kingdom. The mean age of the subjects included in the five trials was 29 years (range 17 to 69 years); 84% were male. Adverse Reactions Reported with ARAKODA in Trial 3 and Pooled Trials 1, 2, 4, and 5 Adverse reactions occurring in \u22651% of subjects in the ARAKODA group in the placebo-controlled pooled Trials 1, 2, 3, and 4 are presented in Table 3 .

The keratopathy did not result in any apparent functional visual changes and resolved within one year after drug cessation in all patients. Retinal abnormalities were noted in less than 1% of subjects receiving ARAKODA. A total of 7 serious ocular adverse reactions (SARs) were reported in ARAKODA-treated subjects in the trials which included ophthalmic evaluations: 5 reports of keratopathy and two reports of retinal disorders.
