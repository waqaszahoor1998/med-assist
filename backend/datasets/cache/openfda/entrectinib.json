    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Moderate and Strong CYP3A Inhibitors : For adult and pediatric patients 2 years and older, reduce the dose of ROZLYTREK if coadministration of moderate or strong CYP3A inhibitors cannot be avoided. ( 2.8 , 7.1 ) For pediatric patients less than 2 years, avoid coadministration with ROZLYTREK. ( 7.1 ) Moderate and Strong CYP3A Inducers : Avoid coadministration with ROZLYTREK. ( 7.1 ) Drugs That Prolong QTc Interval : Avoid concomitant use with ROZLYTREK. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on ROZLYTREK Moderate and Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Adults and Pediatric Patients 2 Years and Older Coadministration of ROZLYTREK with a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor increases entrectinib plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ], which could increase the frequency or severity of adverse reactions. Avoid coadministration of strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors with ROZLYTREK. If coadministration is unavoidable, reduce the ROZLYTREK dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Pediatric Patients less than 2 Years Avoid coadministration of ROZLYTREK with moderate or strong CYP3A inhibitors [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Avoid grapefruit products during treatment with ROZLYTREK, as they contain inhibitors of CYP3A. Moderate and Strong CYP3A Inducers Coadministration of ROZLYTREK with a strong or moderate CYP3A inducer decreases entrectinib plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ], which may reduce ROZLYTREK efficacy. Avoid coadministration of strong and moderate CYP3A inducers with ROZLYTREK . 7.2 Drugs That Prolong QTc Interval QTc interval prolongation can occur with ROZLYTREK. Avoid coadministration of ROZLYTREK with other products with a known potential to prolong QT/QTc interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] ."

Data in WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS and below reflect exposure to ROZLYTREK in 355 patients, including 172 (48%) patients exposed for 6 months or longer and 84 (24%) patients exposed for 1 year or longer.

( 2.9 ) 2.1 Patient Selection Select patients for the treatment of metastatic NSCLC with ROZLYTREK based on the presence of ROS1 rearrangement(s) in tumor or plasma specimens [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Testing using plasma specimens is only appropriate for patients for whom tumor tissue is not available for testing. Information on FDA-approved tests for the detection of ROS1 rearrangement(s) in NSCLC is available at http://www.fda.gov/CompanionDiagnostics. Select patients for treatment of locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors with ROZLYTREK based on the presence of a NTRK gene fusion in tumor or plasma specimens [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Testing using plasma specimens is only appropriate for patients for whom tumor tissue is not available for testing. Information on FDA-approved tests for the detection of NTRK gene fusion(s) in solid tumors is available at http://www.fda.gov/CompanionDiagnostics. 2.2 Recommended Evaluation and Testing Before Initiating ROZLYTREK Before initiating ROZLYTREK, evaluate: left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] serum uric acid levels [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] QT interval and electrolytes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] 2.3 ROZLYTREK Dosage Form Overview The physician should prescribe the most appropriate dosage form of ROZLYTREK according to the dose required and patient needs. ROZLYTREK is available in two dosage forms, and can be administered either as capsules swallowed whole, capsules made into an oral suspension (or for enteral tube administration) and as oral pellets swallowed with soft food.

If coadministration cannot be avoided, reduce the ROZLYTREK dose as shown in Table 5 and limit coadministration to 14 days or less. Table 5. Recommended Dose Modifications of ROZYLTREK for Concomitant Use with Moderate or Strong CYP3A Inhibitors for Adults and Pediatric Patients 2 Years and Older Starting dose For pediatric patients with a starting dose less than 200 mg, avoid coadministration with moderate or strong CYP3A inhibitors Moderate CYP3A inhibitor Strong CYP3A inhibitor 200 mg 50 mg once daily 50 mg on alternate days 300 mg 100 mg once daily 50 mg once daily 400 mg 200 mg once daily 50 mg once daily 600 mg 200 mg once daily 100 mg once daily After discontinuation of a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor for 3 to 5 elimination half-lives, resume the ROZLYTREK dose that was taken prior to initiating the CYP3A inhibitor [see Drug Interactions (7.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 2.9 ROZLYTREK Preparation and Administration Instructions ROZLYTREK Capsules Swallow capsules whole. Do not crush or chew the capsules. ROZLYTREK Capsules Prepared as a Suspension for Oral or Enteral Tube Administration It is recommended that a healthcare provider discuss with the patient or caregiver, the volume of water or milk to be added and oral suspension to withdraw, prior to administration of the first dose (see Table 6 ). Table 6 provides the ROZLYTREK dose and volume of room temperature drinking water or milk required to prepare an oral suspension. Instruct patients or caregivers to carefully open capsule(s) and pour the contents into room temperature drinking water or milk to prepare an oral suspension. Let sit for 15 minutes. Table 6. Preparation of ROZLYTREK Capsules as an Oral Suspension Dose of ROZLYTREK to be administered Dose needed for suspension (using 100 mg or 200 mg capsules, as appropriate) Volume of water or milk to be added Volume of oral suspension to withdraw and administer 20 mg 100 mg 5 mL 1 mL 30 mg 100 mg 5 mL 1.5 mL 40 mg 100 mg 5 mL 2 mL 50 mg 100 mg 5 mL 2.5 mL 60 mg 100 mg 5 mL 3 mL 70 mg 100 mg 5 mL 3.5 mL 80 mg 100 mg 5 mL 4 mL 90 mg 100 mg 5 mL 4.5 mL 100 mg 100 mg 5 mL 5 mL 110 mg 200 mg 10 mL 5.5 mL 120 mg 200 mg 10 mL 6 mL 130 mg 200 mg 10 mL 6.5 mL 140 mg 200 mg 10 mL 7 mL 150 mg 200 mg 10 mL 7.5 mL 200 mg 200 mg 10 mL 10 mL 300 mg 300 mg 15 mL 15 mL 400 mg 400 mg 20 mL 20 mL 600 mg 600 mg 30 mL 30 mL Administer ROZLYTREK oral suspension immediately after preparation. Discard any unused suspension if not used within 2 hours. Instruct patients to drink water after taking the oral suspension to ensure ROZLYTREK has been completely swallowed. Enteral Tube Administration If enteral administration (e.g., gastric or nasogastric tube) is required, administer the oral suspension via the tube. Use an enteral tube that is 8 FR or higher to administer dosing volumes of 3 mL or higher. Instruct patients to divide dosing volumes of 3 mL or higher into at least two aliquots and flush the tube after each administration. Flush the tube with a volume of water or milk that is equal to the aliquot administered. For a dose volume of 30 mL, divide into at least three (10 mL) aliquots. The tube should be flushed with water or milk after delivering each aliquot of ROZLYTREK. Refer to the Instructions for Use for detailed instructions on preparation and administration of ROZLYTREK capsules as an oral suspension via an enteral tube. ROZLYTREK Oral Pellets Sprinkle pellets on one or more spoonfuls of a soft food (e.g., applesauce, yogurt, or pudding) and take within 20 minutes of preparation. Do not crush or chew to avoid a bitter taste. The patient should drink water after taking the pellets to ensure the drug has been completely swallowed. Do not attempt to use partial quantities of pellets from 50 mg pellet packets to prepare a dose. Do not use the pellet formulation for enteral tube administration as the pellets may clog the tube. Refer to the Instructions for Use for detailed instructions on preparation and administration of ROZLYTREK oral pellets."

This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and durability of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trials.
