    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Avoid concomitant administration of COTELLIC with strong or moderate CYP3A inducers or inhibitors. ( 2.3 , 7.1 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Effect of Strong or Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors on COTELLIC Coadministration of COTELLIC with itraconazole (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) increased cobimetinib systemic exposure by 6.7-fold. Avoid concurrent use of COTELLIC and strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors. If concurrent short term (14 days or less) use of moderate CYP3A inhibitors including certain antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, ciprofloxacin) is unavoidable for patients who are taking COTELLIC 60 mg, reduce COTELLIC dose to 20 mg. After discontinuation of a moderate CYP3A inhibitor, resume COTELLIC at the previous dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Use an alternative to a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor in patients who are taking a reduced dose of COTELLIC (40 or 20 mg daily) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.2 Effect of Strong or Moderate CYP3A Inducers on COTELLIC Coadministration of COTELLIC with a strong CYP3A inducer may decrease cobimetinib systemic exposure by more than 80% and reduce its efficacy. Avoid concurrent use of COTELLIC and strong or moderate CYP3A inducers including but not limited to carbamazepine, efavirenz, phenytoin, rifampin, and St. John's Wort [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: New Primary Cutaneous Malignancies [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Cardiomyopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Serious Dermatologic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Serous Retinopathy and Retinal Vein Occlusion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Rhabdomyolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Severe Photosensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Unresectable or Metastatic Melanoma: Most common adverse reactions for COTELLIC (\u226520%) are diarrhea, photosensitivity reaction, nausea, pyrexia, and vomiting. The most common (\u22655%) Grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities are increased GGT, increased CPK, hypophosphatemia, increased ALT, lymphopenia, increased AST, increased alkaline phosphatase, hyponatremia. ( 6.1 ) Histiocytic neoplasms: Most common adverse reactions (\u226520%) are acneiform dermatitis, diarrhea, infection, fatigue, nausea, edema, dry skin, maculopapular rash, pruritus, dyspepsia, vomiting, dyspnea and urinary tract infections. The most common (\u22655%) grade 3-4 lab abnormalities include: Hyponatremia, increased blood creatine phosphokinase, hypokalemia, increased blood creatinine, increased AST, hypocalcemia, lymphopenia, leukopenia, anemia ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Genentech at 1-888-835-2555 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Unresectable or Metastatic Melanoma The safety of COTELLIC was evaluated in Trial 1, a randomized (1:1), double-blind, active-controlled trial in previously untreated patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive, unresectable or metastatic melanoma [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . All patients received vemurafenib 960 mg twice daily on Days 1\u201328 and received either COTELLIC 60 mg once daily (n=247) or placebo (n=246) on Days 1\u201321 of each 28-day treatment cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. In the COTELLIC plus vemurafenib arm, 66% percent of patients were exposed for greater than 6 months and 24% of patients were exposed for greater than 1 year. Patients with abnormal liver function tests, history of acute coronary syndrome within 6 months, evidence of Class II or greater congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association), active central nervous system lesions, or evidence of retinal pathology were excluded from Trial 1. The demographics and baseline tumor characteristics of patients enrolled in Trial 1 are summarized in Clinical Studies [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. In Trial 1, 15% of patients receiving COTELLIC experienced an adverse reaction that resulted in permanent discontinuation of COTELLIC. The most common adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation were liver laboratory abnormalities defined as increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (2.4%), increased gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT) (1.6%) and increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (1.6%); rash (1.6%); pyrexia (1.2%); and retinal detachment (2%). Among the 247 patients receiving COTELLIC, adverse reactions led to dose interruption or reductions in 55%. The most common reasons for dose interruptions or reductions of COTELLIC were rash (11%) , diarrhea (9%), chorioretinopathy (7%), pyrexia (6%), vomiting (6%), nausea (5%), and increased creatine phosphokinase (CPK) (4.9%). The most common (\u226520%) adverse reactions with COTELLIC were diarrhea, photosensitivity reaction, nausea, pyrexia, and vomiting. Table 3.

In Trial 2, 26 patients with histiocytic neoplasms received COTELLIC 60 mg once daily for 21 days on, then 7 days off, in a 28-day treatment cycle. The median treatment duration was 10.7 months. Table 5 presents adverse reactions in at least 15% of patients reported with histiocytic neoplasms treated with COTELLIC. Table 6 presents laboratory abnormalities of grades \u22653 reported in patients with histiocytic neoplasms treated COTELLIC. In Trial 2, 4 patients (15%) receiving COTELLIC experienced an adverse reaction that resulted in permanent discontinuation of COTELLIC. One patient discontinued due to worsening of underlying dyspnea and hypoxia; one patient discontinued due to retinal vascular disorder; one patient discontinued due to hyponatremia; and the other patient discontinued due to pneumonia.
