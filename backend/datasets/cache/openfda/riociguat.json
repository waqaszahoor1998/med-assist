    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022 Strong CYP and P-gp/BCRP inhibitors: For patients receiving strong CYP and P-gp/BCRP inhibitors, consider a starting dose of 0.5 mg three times a day. Monitor for hypotension. (7.2 ) \u2022 Antacids: Separate administration by at least 1 hour. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Pharmacodynamic Interactions with Adempas Other Soluble Guanylate Cyclase Stimulators: Co-administration of Adempas is contraindicated in patients with use of other soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulators [see Contraindications ( 4.4 )]. Nitrates: Co-administration of Adempas with nitrates or nitric oxide donors (such as amyl nitrite) in any form is contraindicated because of hypotension [see Contraindications ( 4.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . PDE Inhibitors: Co-administration of Adempas with specific PDE-5 inhibitors (such as sildenafil, tadalafil, or vardenafil) and nonspecific PDE inhibitors (such as dipyridamole or theophylline), is contraindicated because of hypotension. Do not administer within 24 hours of sildenafil. Do not administer 24 hours before or within 48 hours after tadalafil [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. Clinical experience with co-administration of Adempas and other phosphodiesterase inhibitors (for example, milrinone, cilostazole, roflumilast) is limited. 7.2 Pharmacokinetic Interactions with Adempas Smoking: Plasma concentrations in smokers are reduced by 50% to 60% compared to nonsmokers. Based on pharmacokinetic modeling, for patients who are smokers, doses higher than 2.5 mg three times a day may be considered in order to match exposure seen in nonsmoking patients. Safety and effectiveness of Adempas doses higher than 2.5 mg three times a day have not been established. A dose reduction should be considered in patients who stop smoking [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Strong CYP and P-gp/BCRP inhibitors: Concomitant use of riociguat with strong cytochrome CYP inhibitors and P-gp/BCRP inhibitors such as azole antimycotics (for example, ketoconazole, itraconazole) or HIV protease inhibitors (such as ritonavir) increase riociguat exposure and may result in hypotension. Consider a starting dose of 0.5 mg 3 times a day when initiating Adempas in patients receiving strong CYP and P-gp/BCRP inhibitors. Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension on initiation and on treatment with strong CYP and P-gp/BCRP inhibitors. A dose reduction should be considered in patients who may not tolerate the hypotensive effect of riociguat [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Strong CYP3A inducers: Strong inducers of CYP3A (for example, rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital or St. John\u2019s Wort) may significantly reduce riociguat exposure. Data are not available to guide dosing of riociguat when strong CYP3A inducers are co-administered. [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Antacids: Antacids such as aluminum hydroxide/magnesium hydroxide decrease riociguat absorption and should not be taken within 1 hour of taking Adempas [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: \u2022 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] \u2022 Hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] \u2022 Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Adverse reactions occurring more frequently (\u22653%) on Adempas compared to placebo are headache, dyspepsia/gastritis, dizziness, nausea, diarrhea, hypotension, vomiting, anemia, gastroesophageal reflux, and constipation. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-888-842-2937 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety data described below reflect exposure to Adempas in two, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trials in patients with inoperable or recurrent/persistent CTEPH (CHEST-1) and treatment naive or pre-treated PAH patients (PATENT-1). The population (Adempas: n = 490; Placebo: n = 214) was between the age of 18 and 80 years [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 , 14.2 )]. The safety profile of Adempas in patients with inoperable or recurrent/persistent CTEPH (CHEST-1) and treatment naive or pre-treated PAH (PATENT-1) were similar. Therefore, adverse drug reactions (ADRs) identified from the 12 and 16 week placebo-controlled trials for PAH and CTEPH respectively were pooled, and those occurring more frequently on Adempas than placebo (\u22653%) are displayed in Table 1 below. Most adverse reactions in Table 1 can be ascribed to the vasodilatory mechanism of action of Adempas. The overall rates of discontinuation due to an adverse event in the pivotal placebo-controlled trials were 2.9% for Adempas and 5.1% for placebo (pooled data). Table 1: Adverse Reactions Occurring More Frequently (\u22653%) on Adempas than Placebo (Pooled from CHEST-1 and PATENT-1) Adverse Reactions Adempas % (n=490) Placebo % (n=214) Headache 27 18 Dyspepsia and Gastritis 21 8 Dizziness 20 13 Nausea 14 11 Diarrhea 12 8 Hypotension 10 4 Vomiting 10 7 Anemia (including laboratory parameters) 7 2 Gastroesophageal reflux disease 5 2 Constipation 5 1 Other events that were seen more frequently in Adempas compared to placebo and potentially related to treatment were: palpitations, nasal congestion, epistaxis, dysphagia, abdominal distension and peripheral edema. With longer observation in uncontrolled long-term extension studies the safety profile was similar to that observed in the placebo controlled phase 3 trials."
