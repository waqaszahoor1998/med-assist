    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Digoxin : Monitor digoxin levels. ( 7.1 ) Uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase Inducers (e.g., rifampin): Sotagliflozin exposure is reduced. Consider monitoring of clinical status. ( 7.2 ) Lithium: Monitor serum lithium concentrations. ( 7.3 ) 7.1 Digoxin There is an increase in the exposure of digoxin when coadministered with INPEFA 400 mg. Patients taking INPEFA with concomitant digoxin should be monitored appropriately [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.2 Uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) Inducer Glucuronidation by UGT1A9, to form the 3-O-glucuronide, was identified as a major metabolic pathway for sotagliflozin. The coadministration of rifampicin, an inducer of UGTs, with a single dose of 400 mg sotagliflozin resulted in a decrease in the exposure to sotagliflozin. This decrease in exposure to sotagliflozin may decrease efficacy [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.3 Lithium Concomitant use of an SGLT2 inhibitor with lithium may decrease serum lithium concentrations. Monitor serum lithium concentration more frequently during INPEFA initiation and dosage changes."

    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following important adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Diabetic Ketoacidosis in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus and Other Ketoacidosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Volume Depletion [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Necrotizing Fasciitis of the Perineum (Fournier's Gangrene) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Genital Mycotic Infections [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] Most common adverse reactions (incidence \u2265 5%) are urinary tract infection, volume depletion, diarrhea, and hypoglycemia.

In the phase 3 (SOLOIST [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] and SCORED [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] ) placebo-controlled trials, 5,896 subjects received INPEFA. In the SOLOIST study, 336 patients (56%) reached the 400 mg dose. In the SCORED study, 3,934 patients (74%) reached the 400 mg dose. In the SOLOIST study, 5.6% of patients in the INPEFA group and 5.4% of patients in the placebo group discontinued therapy due to adverse events (AEs). In the SCORED study, 5.0% of patients in the INPEFA group and 4.5% of patients in the placebo group discontinued therapy due to AEs.

These changes in serum creatinine and eGFR generally occur within 4 weeks of starting therapy and then stabilize regardless of baseline kidney function. Changes that do not fit this pattern should prompt further evaluation to exclude the possibility of acute kidney injury. In studies that included patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with moderate renal impairment, the acute effect on eGFR reversed after treatment discontinuation, suggesting acute hemodynamic changes may play a role in the renal function changes observed with INPEFA [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] ."

  "dosage_administration": [
    "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Correct volume status before starting INPEFA at 200 mg daily and titrate to 400 mg as tolerated. ( 2.2 ) In patients with decompensated heart failure, begin dosing when patients are hemodynamically stable. ( 2.1 ) Withhold INPEFA at least 3 days, if possible, prior to major surgery or procedures associated with prolonged fasting. ( 2.3 ) 2.1 Prior to Initiation of INPEFA Assess volume status and, if necessary, correct volume depletion prior to initiation of INPEFA [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 , 8.6 )] . Assess renal function prior to initiation of INPEFA and then as clinically indicated [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . For patients with decompensated heart failure, dosing may begin as soon as the patient is hemodynamically stable, including during hospitalization or urgent outpatient treatment or immediately upon discharge. 2.2 Recommended Dosage The recommended starting dose of INPEFA is 200 mg orally once daily not more than one hour before the first meal of the day. Up-titrate after at least 2 weeks to 400 mg orally once daily as tolerated [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . Down-titrate to 200 mg as necessary [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )]. Swallow tablets whole. Do not cut, crush, or chew tablets. If a dose of INPEFA is missed by more than 6 hours, take the next dose as prescribed the next day. 2.3 Temporary Interruption for Surgery Withhold INPEFA at least 3 days, if possible, prior to major surgery or procedures associated with prolonged fasting. Resume INPEFA when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."
