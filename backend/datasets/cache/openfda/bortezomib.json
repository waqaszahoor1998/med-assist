(7.3) 7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Bortezomib Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Coadministration with a strong CYP3A4 inducer decreases the exposure of bortezomib [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] which may decrease bortezomib efficacy. Avoid coadministration with strong CYP3A4 inducers. Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Coadministration with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor increases the exposure of bortezomib [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] which may increase the risk of bortezomib toxicities. Monitor patients for signs of bortezomib toxicity and consider a bortezomib dose reduction if bortezomib must be given in combination with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. 7.2 Drugs Without Clinically Significant Interactions with Bortezomib No clinically significant drug interactions have been observed when bortezomib was coadministered with dexamethasone, omeprazole, or melphalan in combination with prednisone [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

Summary of Clinical Trial in Patients with Previously Untreated Multiple Myeloma Table 9 describes safety data from 340 patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma who received bortezomib (1.3 mg/m 2 ) administered intravenously in combination with melphalan (9 mg/m 2 ) and prednisone (60 mg/m 2 ) in a prospective randomized study. The safety profile of bortezomib in combination with melphalan/prednisone is consistent with the known safety profiles of both bortezomib and melphalan/prednisone.

Bortezomib was administered intravenously at doses of 1.3 mg/m 2 twice weekly for two out of three weeks (21 day cycle). After eight, 21 day cycles patients continued therapy for three, 35 day cycles on a weekly schedule. Duration of treatment was up to 11 cycles (nine months) with a median duration of six cycles (4.1 months). For inclusion in the trial, patients must have had measurable disease and one to three prior therapies. There was no upper age limit for entry. Creatinine clearance could be as low as 20 mL/min and bilirubin levels as high as 1.5 times the upper limit of normal. The overall frequency of adverse reactions was similar in men and women, and in patients < 65 and \u2265 65 years of age. Most patients were Caucasian [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )]. Among the 331 bortezomib-treated patients, the most commonly reported (> 20%) adverse reactions overall were nausea (52%), diarrhea (52%), fatigue (39%), peripheral neuropathies (35%), thrombocytopenia (33%), constipation (30%), vomiting (29%), and anorexia (21%). The most commonly reported (> 20%) adverse reaction reported among the 332 patients in the dexamethasone group was fatigue (25%). Eight percent (8%) of patients in the bortezomibtreated arm experienced a Grade 4 adverse reaction; the most common reactions were thrombocytopenia (4%) and neutropenia (2%). Nine percent (9%) of dexamethasone-treated patients experienced a Grade 4 adverse reaction. All individual dexamethasone- related Grade 4 adverse reactions were less than 1%. Serious Adverse Reactions and Adverse Reactions Leading to Treatment Discontinuation in the Relapsed Multiple Myeloma Study of Bortezomib vs Dexamethasone Serious adverse reactions are defined as any reaction that results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongs a current hospitalization, results in a significant disability, or is deemed to be an important medical event. A total of 80 (24%) patients from the bortezomib treatment arm experienced a serious adverse reaction during the study, as did 83 (25%) dexamethasone-treated patients. The most commonly reported serious adverse reactions in the bortezomib treatment arm were diarrhea (3%), dehydration, herpes zoster, pyrexia, nausea, vomiting, dyspnea, and thrombocytopenia (2% each). In the dexamethasone treatment group, the most commonly reported serious adverse reactions were pneumonia (4%), hyperglycemia (3%), pyrexia, and psychotic disorder (2% each). A total of 145 patients, including 84 (25%) of 331 patients in the bortezomib treatment group and 61 (18%) of 332 patients in the dexamethasone treatment group were discontinued from treatment due to adverse reactions. Among the 331 bortezomib-treated patients, the most commonly reported adverse reaction leading to discontinuation was peripheral neuropathy (8%). Among the 332 patients in the dexamethasone group, the most commonly reported adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation were psychotic disorder and hyperglycemia (2% each). Four deaths were considered to be bortezomib -related in this relapsed multiple myeloma study: one case each of cardiogenic shock, respiratory insufficiency, congestive heart failure and cardiac arrest. Four deaths were considered dexamethasone-related: two cases of sepsis, one case of bacterial meningitis, and one case of sudden death at home. Most Commonly Reported Adverse Reactions in the Relapsed Multiple Myeloma Study of Bortezomib vs Dexamethasone The most common adverse reactions from the relapsed multiple myeloma study are shown in Table 10 . All adverse reactions with incidence \u2265 10% in the bortezomib arm are included.

These patients were treated for a total of 5.3 to 23 months, including time on bortezomib in the prior bortezomib study [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )]. Safety Experience from the Phase 3 Open-Label Study of Bortezomib Subcutaneous vs Intravenous in Relapsed Multiple Myeloma The safety and efficacy of bortezomib administered subcutaneously were evaluated in one Phase 3 study at the recommended dose of 1.3 mg/m 2 . This was a randomized, comparative study of bortezomib subcutaneous vs intravenous in 222 patients with relapsed multiple myeloma. The safety data described below and in Table 11 reflect exposure to either bortezomib subcutaneous (N=147) or bortezomib intravenous (N=74) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )].

Differences were observed in the rates of some Grade \u2265 3 adverse reactions. Differences of \u2265 5% were reported in neuralgia (3% subcutaneous vs 9% intravenous), peripheral neuropathies (6% subcutaneous vs 15% intravenous), neutropenia (13% subcutaneous vs 18% intravenous), and thrombocytopenia (8% subcutaneous vs 16% intravenous). A local reaction was reported in 6% of patients in the subcutaneous group, mostly redness. Only two (1%) patients were reported as having severe reactions, one case of pruritus and one case of redness. Local reactions led to reduction in injection concentration in one patient and drug discontinuation in one patient. Local reactions resolved in a median of six days. Dose reductions occurred due to adverse reactions in 31% of patients in the subcutaneous treatment group compared with 43% of the intravenously- treated patients. The most common adverse reactions leading to a dose reduction included peripheral sensory neuropathy (17% in the subcutaneous treatment group compared with 31% in the intravenous treatment group); and neuralgia (11% in the subcutaneous treatment group compared with 19% in the intravenous treatment group). Serious Adverse Reactions and Adverse Reactions Leading to Treatment Discontinuation in the Relapsed Multiple Myeloma Study of bortezomib Subcutaneous vs Intravenous The incidence of serious adverse reactions was similar for the subcutaneous treatment group (20%) and the intravenous treatment group (19%). The most commonly reported serious adverse reactions in the subcutaneous treatment arm were pneumonia and pyrexia (2% each). In the intravenous treatment group, the most commonly reported serious adverse reactions were pneumonia, diarrhea, and peripheral sensory neuropathy (3% each). In the subcutaneous treatment group, 27 patients (18%) discontinued study treatment due to an adverse reaction compared with 17 patients (23%) in the intravenous treatment group. Among the 147 subcutaneously-treated patients, the most commonly reported adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were peripheral sensory neuropathy (5%) and neuralgia (5%). Among the 74 patients in the intravenous treatment group, the most commonly reported adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation were peripheral sensory neuropathy (9%) and neuralgia (9%). Two patients (1%) in the subcutaneous treatment group and one (1%) patient in the intravenous treatment group died due to an adverse reaction during treatment. In the subcutaneous group the causes of death were one case of pneumonia and one case of sudden death. In the intravenous group the cause of death was coronary artery insufficiency. Safety Experience from the Clinical Trial in Patients with Previously Untreated Mantle Cell Lymphoma Table 12 describes safety data from 240 patients with previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma who received bortezomib (1.3 mg/m 2 ) administered intravenously in combination with rituximab (375 mg/m 2 ), cyclophosphamide (750 mg/m 2 ), doxorubicin (50 mg/m 2 ), and prednisone (100 mg/m 2 ) (VcR-CAP) in a prospective randomized study. Infections were reported for 31% of patients in the VcR-CAP arm and 23% of the patients in the comparator (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone [R-CHOP]) arm, including the predominant preferred term of pneumonia (VcR-CAP 8% vs R-CHOP 5%).

Antiviral prophylaxis was mandated by protocol amendment. The incidences of Grade \u22653 bleeding events were similar between the two arms (four patients in the VcR-CAP arm and three patients in the R-CHOP arm). All of the Grade \u22653 bleeding events resolved without sequelae in the VcR-CAP arm. Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation occurred in 8% of patients in VcR-CAP group and 6% of patients in R-CHOP group. In the VcR-CAP group, the most commonly reported adverse reaction leading to discontinuation was peripheral sensory neuropathy (1%; three patients). The most commonly reported adverse reaction leading to discontinuation in the R-CHOP group was febrile neutropenia (<1%; two patients). Integrated Summary of Safety (Relapsed Multiple Myeloma and Relapsed Mantle Cell Lymphoma) Safety data from Phase 2 and 3 studies of single agent bortezomib 1.3 mg/m 2 /dose twice weekly for two weeks followed by a ten day rest period in 1163 patients with previously-treated multiple myeloma (N=1008) and previously-treated mantle cell lymphoma (N=155) were integrated and tabulated. This analysis does not include data from the Phase 3 open-label study of bortezomib subcutaneous vs intravenous in relapsed multiple myeloma. In the integrated studies, the safety profile of bortezomib was similar in patients with multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. In the integrated analysis, the most commonly reported (> 20%) adverse reactions were nausea (49%), diarrhea (46%), asthenic conditions including fatigue (41%) and weakness (11%), peripheral neuropathies (38%), thrombocytopenia (32%), vomiting (28%), constipation (25%), and pyrexia (21%). Eleven percent (11%) of patients experienced at least one episode of \u2265 Grade 4 toxicity, most commonly thrombocytopenia (4%) and neutropenia (2%). In the Phase 2 relapsed multiple myeloma clinical trials of bortezomib administered intravenously, local skin irritation was reported in 5% of patients, but extravasation of bortezomib was not associated with tissue damage. Serious Adverse Reactions and Adverse Reactions Leading to Treatment Discontinuation in the Integrated Summary of Safety A total of 26% of patients experienced a serious adverse reaction during the studies. The most commonly reported serious adverse reactions included diarrhea, vomiting and pyrexia (3% each), nausea, dehydration, and thrombocytopenia (2% each) and pneumonia, dyspnea, peripheral neuropathies, and herpes zoster (1% each). Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation occurred in 22% of patients. The reasons for discontinuation included peripheral neuropathy (8%), and fatigue, thrombocytopenia, and diarrhea (2% each). In total, 2% of the patients died and the cause of death was considered by the investigator to be possibly related to study drug: including reports of cardiac arrest, congestive heart failure, respiratory failure, renal failure, pneumonia and sepsis. Most Commonly Reported Adverse Reactions in the Integrated Summary of Safety The most common adverse reactions are shown in Table 13 . All adverse reactions occurring at \u2265 10% are included. In the absence of a randomized comparator arm, it is often not possible to distinguish between adverse events that are drug-caused and those that reflect the patient's underlying disease. Please see the discussion of specific adverse reactions that follows.

The most common gastrointestinal disorders included nausea, diarrhea, constipation, vomiting, and appetite decreased. Other gastrointestinal disorders included dyspepsia and dysgeusia. Grade 3 adverse reactions occurred in 14% of patients; \u2265 Grade 4 adverse reactions were \u2264 1%. Gastrointestinal adverse reactions were considered serious in 7% of patients. Four percent (4%) of patients discontinued due to a gastrointestinal adverse reaction. Nausea was reported more often in patients with multiple myeloma (51%) compared to patients with mantle cell lymphoma (36%). Thrombocytopenia Across the studies, bortezomib-associated thrombocytopenia was characterized by a decrease in platelet count during the dosing period (Days 1 to 11) and a return toward baseline during the ten day rest period during each treatment cycle. Overall, thrombocytopenia was reported in 32% of patients. Thrombocytopenia was Grade 3 in 22%, \u2265 Grade 4 in 4%, and serious in 2% of patients, and the reaction resulted in bortezomib discontinuation in 2% of patients [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7) ] . Thrombocytopenia was reported more often in patients with multiple myeloma (34%) compared to patients with mantle cell lymphoma (16%). The incidence of \u2265 Grade 3 thrombocytopenia also was higher in patients with multiple myeloma (28%) compared to patients with mantle cell lymphoma (8%). Peripheral Neuropathy Overall, peripheral neuropathies occurred in 38% of patients. Peripheral neuropathy was Grade 3 for 11% of patients and \u2265 Grade 4 for < 1% of patients. Eight percent (8%) of patients discontinued bortezomib due to peripheral neuropathy. The incidence of peripheral neuropathy was higher among patients with mantle cell lymphoma (54%) compared to patients with multiple myeloma (36%). In the bortezomib vs dexamethasone Phase 3 relapsed multiple myeloma study, among the 62 bortezomib-treated patients who experienced \u2265 Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy and had dose adjustments, 48% had improved or resolved with a median of 3.8 months from first onset. In the Phase 2 relapsed multiple myeloma studies, among the 30 patients who experienced Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy resulting in discontinuation or who experienced \u2265 Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy, 73% reported improvement or resolution with a median time of 47 days to improvement of one grade or more from the last dose of bortezomib. Hypotension The incidence of hypotension (postural, orthostatic and hypotension NOS) was 8% in patients treated with bortezomib. Hypotension was Grade 1 or 2 in the majority of patients and Grade 3 in 2% and \u2265 Grade 4 in < 1%. Two percent (2%) of patients had hypotension reported as a serious adverse reaction, and 1% discontinued due to hypotension. The incidence of hypotension was similar in patients with multiple myeloma (8%) and those with mantle cell lymphoma (9%). In addition, < 1% of patients experienced hypotension associated with a syncopal reaction. Neutropenia Neutrophil counts decreased during the bortezomib dosing period (Days 1 to 11) and returned toward baseline during the ten day rest period during each treatment cycle. Overall, neutropenia occurred in 15% of patients and was Grade 3 in 8% of patients and \u2265 Grade 4 in 2%. Neutropenia was reported as a serious adverse reaction in < 1% of patients and < 1% of patients discontinued due to neutropenia. The incidence of neutropenia was higher in patients with multiple myeloma (16%) compared to patients with mantle cell lymphoma (5%). The incidence of \u2265 Grade 3 neutropenia also was higher in patients with multiple myeloma (12%) compared to patients with mantle cell lymphoma (3%). Asthenic Conditions (Fatigue, Malaise, Weakness, Asthenia) Asthenic conditions were reported in 54% of patients. Fatigue was reported as Grade 3 in 7% and \u2265 Grade 4 in < 1% of patients. Asthenia was reported as Grade 3 in 2% and \u2265 Grade 4 in < 1% of patients. Two percent (2%) of patients discontinued treatment due to fatigue and < 1% due to weakness and asthenia. Asthenic conditions were reported in 53% of patients with multiple myeloma and 59% of patients with mantle cell lymphoma. Pyrexia Pyrexia (> 38\u00baC) was reported as an adverse reaction for 21% of patients. The reaction was Grade 3 in 1% and \u2265 Grade 4 in < 1%. Pyrexia was reported as a serious adverse reaction in 3% of patients and led to bortezomib discontinuation in < 1% of patients. The incidence of pyrexia was higher among patients with multiple myeloma (23%) compared to patients with mantle cell lymphoma (10%). The incidence of \u2265 Grade 3 pyrexia was 1% in patients with multiple myeloma and < 1% in patients with mantle cell lymphoma. Herpes Virus Infection Consider using antiviral prophylaxis in subjects being treated with bortezomib. In the randomized studies in previously untreated and relapsed multiple myeloma, herpes zoster reactivation was more common in subjects treated with bortezomib (ranging between 6 to 11%) than in the control groups (3 to 4%). Herpes simplex was seen in 1 to 3% in subjects treated with bortezomib and 1 to 3% in the control groups. In the previously untreated multiple myeloma study, herpes zoster virus reactivation in the bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone arm was less common in subjects receiving prophylactic antiviral therapy (3%) than in subjects who did not receive prophylactic antiviral therapy (17%). Retreatment in Relapsed Multiple Myeloma A single-arm trial was conducted in 130 patients with relapsed multiple myeloma to determine the efficacy and safety of retreatment with intravenous bortezomib. The safety profile of patients in this trial is consistent with the known safety profile of bortezomib-treated patients with relapsed multiple myeloma as demonstrated in Tables 10, 11 , and 13 ; no cumulative toxicities were observed upon retreatment. The most common adverse drug reaction was thrombocytopenia which occurred in 52% of the patients. The incidence of \u2265 Grade 3 thrombocytopenia was 24%. Peripheral neuropathy occurred in 28% of patients, with the incidence of \u2265 Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy reported at 6%. The incidence of serious adverse reactions was 12.3%. The most commonly reported serious adverse reactions were thrombocytopenia (3.8%), diarrhea (2.3%), and herpes zoster and pneumonia (1.5% each). Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation occurred in 13% of patients. The reasons for discontinuation included peripheral neuropathy (5%) and diarrhea (3%). Two deaths considered to be bortezomib-related occurred within 30 days of the last bortezomib dose; one in a patient with cerebrovascular accident and one in a patient with sepsis.

Exercise caution when calculating the volume to be administered. ( 2.1 , 2.10 ) \u2022 The recommended starting dose of bortezomib for injection is 1.3 mg/m 2 administered either as a 3 to 5 second bolus intravenous injection or subcutaneous injection. ( 2.2 , 2.4 , 2.6 ) \u2022 Retreatment for Multiple Myeloma: May retreat starting at the last tolerated dose. ( 2.6 ) \u2022 Hepatic Impairment: Use a lower starting dose for patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. ( 2.8 ) \u2022 Dose must be individualized to prevent overdose. ( 2.10 ) 2.1 Important Dosing Guidelines Bortezomib for injection is for intravenous or subcutaneous use only. Do not administer bortezomib for injection by any other route. Because each route of administration has a different reconstituted concentration, use caution when calculating the volume to be administered. The recommended starting dose of bortezomib for injection is 1.3 mg/m 2 . Bortezomib for injection is administered intravenously at a concentration of 1 mg/mL, or subcutaneously at a concentration of 2.5 mg/mL [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.10 )]. Bortezomib for injection retreatment may be considered for patients with multiple myeloma who had previously responded to treatment with bortezomib for injection and who have relapsed at least six months after completing prior bortezomib for injection treatment. Treatment may be started at the last tolerated dose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 )]. When administered intravenously, administer bortezomib for injection as a 3 to 5 second bolus intravenous injection. 2.2 Dosage in Previously Untreated Multiple Myeloma Bortezomib for injection is administered in combination with oral melphalan and oral prednisone for 9, six week treatment cycles as shown in Table 1 . In Cycles 1 to 4, bortezomib for injection is administered twice weekly (Days 1, 4, 8, 11, 22, 25, 29 and 32). In Cycles 5 to 9, bortezomib for injection is administered once weekly (Days 1, 8, 22 and 29). At least 72 hours should elapse between consecutive doses of bortezomib for injection.

Then, bortezomib for injection may be reinitiated with one dose level reduction (from 1.3 mg/m 2 to 1 mg/m 2 , or from 1 mg/m 2 to 0.7 mg/m 2 ). For bortezomib for injection-related neuropathic pain and/or peripheral neuropathy, hold or modify bortezomib for injection as outlined in Table 5 . For information concerning melphalan and prednisone, see manufacturer's prescribing information. Dose modifications guidelines for peripheral neuropathy are provided [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 )]. 2.4 Dosage in Previously Untreated Mantle Cell Lymphoma Bortezomib for injection (1.3 mg/m 2 ) is administered intravenously in combination with intravenous rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and oral prednisone (VcR-CAP) for 6, three week treatment cycles as shown in Table 3 . Bortezomib for injection is administered first followed by rituximab. Bortezomib for injection is administered twice weekly for two weeks (Days 1, 4, 8, and 11) followed by a ten day rest period on Days 12 to 21. For patients with a response first documented at Cycle 6, two additional VcR-CAP cycles are recommended. At least 72 hours should elapse between consecutive doses of bortezomib for injection.

For dose adjustments, see Table 4 below. Table 4: Dose Modifications on Days 4, 8, and 11 During Cycles of Combination Bortezomib for Injection, Rituximab, Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin and Prednisone Therapy Toxicity Dose Modification or Delay Hematological Toxicity Grade 3 or higher neutropenia, or a platelet count not at or above 25 \u00d7 10 9 /L Withhold bortezomib for injection therapy for up to 2 weeks until the patient has an ANC at or above 0.75 \u00d7 10 9 /L and a platelet count at or above 25 \u00d7 10 9 /L. \u2022 If, after bortezomib for injection has been withheld, the toxicity does not resolve, discontinue bortezomib for injection. \u2022 If toxicity resolves such that the patient has an ANC at or above 0.75 \u00d7 10 9 /L and a platelet count at or above 25 \u00d7 10 9 /L, bortezomib for injection dose should be reduced by 1 dose level (from 1.3 mg/m 2 to 1 mg/m 2 , or from 1 mg/m 2 to 0.7 mg/m 2 ). Grade 3 or higher nonhematological toxicities Withhold bortezomib for injection therapy until symptoms of the toxicity have resolved to Grade 2 or better. Then, bortezomib for injection may be reinitiated with one dose level reduction (from 1.3 mg/m 2 to 1 mg/m 2 , or from 1 mg/m 2 to 0.7 mg/m 2 ). For bortezomib for injection-related neuropathic pain and/or peripheral neuropathy, hold or modify bortezomib for injection as outlined in Table 5 . For information concerning rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone, see manufacturer's prescribing information. 2.6 Dosage and Dose Modifications for Relapsed Multiple Myeloma and Relapsed Mantle Cell Lymphoma Bortezomib for injection (1.3 mg/m 2 /dose) is administered twice weekly for two weeks (Days 1, 4, 8, and 11) followed by a ten day rest period (Days 12 to 21). For extended therapy of more than eight cycles, bortezomib for injection may be administered on the standard schedule or, for relapsed multiple myeloma, on a maintenance schedule of once weekly for four weeks (Days 1, 8, 15, and 22) followed by a 13 day rest period (Days 23 to 35) [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. At least 72 hours should elapse between consecutive doses of bortezomib for injection. Patients with multiple myeloma who have previously responded to treatment with bortezomib for injection (either alone or in combination) and who have relapsed at least six months after their prior bortezomib for injection therapy may be started on bortezomib for injection at the last tolerated dose. Retreated patients are administered bortezomib for injection twice weekly (Days 1, 4, 8, and 11) every three weeks for a maximum of eight cycles. At least 72 hours should elapse between consecutive doses of bortezomib for injection. Bortezomib for injection may be administered either as a single agent or in combination with dexamethasone [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )]. Bortezomib for injection therapy should be withheld at the onset of any Grade 3 nonhematological or Grade 4 hematological toxicities excluding neuropathy as discussed below [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 )]. Once the symptoms of the toxicity have resolved, bortezomib for injection therapy may be reinitiated at a 25% reduced dose (1.3 mg/m 2 /dose reduced to 1 mg/m 2 /dose; 1 mg/m 2 /dose reduced to 0.7 mg/m 2 /dose). For dose modifications guidelines for peripheral neuropathy, see section 2.7. 2.7 Dose Modifications for Peripheral Neuropathy Starting bortezomib for injection subcutaneously may be considered for patients with pre-existing or at high risk of peripheral neuropathy. Patients with preexisting severe neuropathy should be treated with bortezomib for injection only after careful risk-benefit assessment. Patients experiencing new or worsening peripheral neuropathy during bortezomib for injection therapy may require a decrease in the dose and/or a less doseintense schedule. For dose or schedule modification guidelines for patients who experience bortezomib for injection-related neuropathic pain and/or peripheral neuropathy, see Table 5. Table 5: Recommended Dose Modification for Bortezomib for Injection-Related Neuropathic Pain and/or Peripheral Sensory or Motor Neuropathy Severity of Peripheral Neuropathy Signs and Symptoms* Modification of Dose and Regimen Grade 1 (asymptomatic; loss of deep tendon reflexes or paresthesia) without pain or loss of function No action Grade 1 with pain or Grade 2 (moderate symptoms; limiting instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADL) \u2020 ) Reduce bortezomib for injection to 1 mg/m 2 Grade 2 with pain or Grade 3 (severe symptoms; limiting self care ADL \u2021 ) Withhold bortezomib for injection therapy until toxicity resolves. When toxicity resolves reinitiate with a reduced dose of bortezomib for injection at 0.7 mg/m 2 once per week. Grade 4 (life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated) Discontinue bortezomib for injection * Grading based on NCI Common Terminology Criteria CTCAE v4.0 \u2020 Instrumental ADL: refers to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using telephone, managing money, etc. \u2021 Self care ADL: refers to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden 2.8 Dosage in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Do not adjust the starting dose for patients with mild hepatic impairment. Start patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment at a reduced dose of 0.7 mg/m 2 per injection during the first cycle, and consider subsequent dose escalation to 1 mg/m 2 or further dose reduction to 0.5 mg/m 2 based on patient tolerance (see Table 6) [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Table 6: Recommended Starting Dose Modification for Bortezomib for Injection in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Bilirubin Level SGOT (AST) Levels Modification of Starting Dose Mild Less than or equal to 1x ULN More than ULN None More than 1x to 1.5x ULN Any None Moderate More than 1.5x to 3x ULN Any Reduce bortezomib for injection to 0.7 mg/m 2 in the first cycle. Consider dose escalation to 1 mg/m 2 or further dose reduction to 0.5 mg/m 2 in subsequent cycles based on patient tolerability. Severe More than 3x ULN Any Abbreviations: SGOT = serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase; AST = aspartate aminotransferase; ULN = upper limit of the normal range. 2.9 Administration Precautions The drug quantity contained in one vial (3.5 mg) may exceed the usual dose required. Caution should be used in calculating the dose to prevent overdose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.10 )]. When administered subcutaneously, sites for each injection (thigh or abdomen) should be rotated. New injections should be given at least one inch from an old site and never into areas where the site is tender, bruised, erythematous, or indurated. If local injection site reactions occur following bortezomib for injection administration subcutaneously, a less concentrated bortezomib for injection solution (1 mg/mL instead of 2.5 mg/mL) may be administered subcutaneously [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.10 )] . Alternatively, consider use of the intravenous route of administration [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.10 )] . Bortezomib for injection is a hazardous drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures. 1 2.10 Reconstitution/Preparation for Intravenous and Subcutaneous Administration Use proper aseptic technique. Reconstitute only with 0.9% sodium chloride. The reconstituted product should be a clear and colorless solution. Different volumes of 0.9% sodium chloride are used to reconstitute the product for the different routes of administration. The reconstituted concentration of bortezomib for subcutaneous administration (2.5 mg/mL) is greater than the reconstituted concentration of bortezomib for intravenous administration (1 mg/mL). Because each route of administration has a different reconstituted concentration, use caution when calculating the volume to be administered [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.9 )]. For each 3.5 mg single-dose vial of bortezomib, reconstitute with the following volume of 0.9% sodium chloride based on route of administration (Table 7): Table 7: Reconstitution Volumes and Final Concentration for Intravenous and Subcutaneous Administration Route of Administration Bortezomib (mg/vial) Diluent (0.9% Sodium Chloride) Final Bortezomib Concentration (mg/mL) Intravenous 3.5 mg 3.5 mL 1 mg/mL Subcutaneous 3.5 mg 1.4 mL 2.5 mg/mL Dose must be individualized to prevent overdosage. After determining patient body surface area (BSA) in square meters, use the following equations to calculate the total volume (mL) of reconstituted bortezomib for injection to be administered: \u00b7 Intravenous Administration [1 mg/mL concentration] Bortezomib for injection dose (mg/m 2 ) x patient BSA (m 2 ) = Total bortezomib for injection volume (mL) to be administered 1 mg/mL \u00b7 S ubcutaneous Administration [2.5 mg/mL concentration] Bortezomib for injection dose (mg/m 2 ) x patient BSA (m 2 ) = Total bortezomib for injection volume (mL) to be administered 2.5 mg/mL Stickers that indicate the route of administration are provided with each bortezomib for injection vial. These stickers should be placed directly on the syringe of bortezomib for injection once bortezomib for injection is prepared to help alert practitioners of the correct route of administration for bortezomib for injection. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. If any discoloration or particulate matter is observed, the reconstituted product should not be used. Stability Unopened vials of bortezomib for injection are stable until the date indicated on the package when stored in the original package protected from light. Bortezomib for Injection contains no antimicrobial preservative. Administer reconstituted bortezomib for injection within eight hours of preparation. When reconstituted as directed, bortezomib for injection may be stored at 25\u00baC (77\u00baF). The reconstituted material may be stored in the original vial and/or the syringe prior to administration. The product may be stored for up to eight hours in a syringe; however, total storage time for the reconstituted material must not exceed eight hours when exposed to normal indoor lighting."
