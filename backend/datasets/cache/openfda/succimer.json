    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS CHEMET may interfere with serum and urinary laboratory test. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Laboratory Test Interference CHEMET may interfere with serum and urinary laboratory tests. In vitro studies have shown CHEMET to cause false positive results for ketones in urine using nitroprusside reagents and falsely decreased measurements of serum uric acid and creatinine phosphokinase (CPK). 7.2 Use with Other Chelation Therapies Concomitant administration of CHEMET with other chelation therapy, such as CaNa 2 EDTA is not recommended."

    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Hypersensitivity and Dermatologic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Neutropenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Hepatic Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Most common adverse reactions (incidence \u2265 10%) in Pediatric patients: Digestive (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, appetite loss, hemorrhoidal symptoms, metallic taste in mouth).

Table 2 presents the adverse reactions associated with Chemet in pediatric patients.

  "dosage_administration": [
    "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION See Full Prescribing Information for important pretreatment evaluations. ( 2.1 ) Ensure patients receiving CHEMET are adequately hydrated. ( 2.3 ) Administer CHEMET capsules whole when possible. ( 2.3 ) Pediatric patients who cannot swallow whole capsules: Sprinkle contents of capsule in food (or on a spoon followed by a drink). ( 2.3 ) Recommended Dosage: 10 mg/kg or 350 mg/m 2 orally every 8 hours for five days followed by 10 mg/kg or 350 mg/m 2 orally every 12 hours for an additional 14 days. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Important Pretreatment Evaluations Identify the source of lead in the pediatric patient's environment and eliminate the source prior to beginning treatment with CHEMET. Assess the following before initiating treatment with CHEMET: Blood lead concentration Complete blood count (CBC) with differential and platelets [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Ensure absolute neutrophil count (ANC) > 1500/mcL [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] Transaminases (AST/ALT) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] Renal function with blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, urinary protein [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Patients who have previously received Edetate calcium disodium (CaNa 2 EDTA) with or without dimercaprol may receive CHEMET for subsequent treatment after an interval of four weeks. 2.2 Recommended Dosage The recommended dosage of CHEMET for pediatric patients with lead poisoning is 10 mg/kg or 350 mg/m 2 orally every 8 hours for five days followed by 10 mg/kg or 350 mg/m 2 orally every 12 hours for an additional 14 days [see Table 1 CHEMET Pediatric Dosing Chart ]. Initiation of therapy at higher doses is not recommended. The total treatment course consists of 19 days. After discontinuation of CHEMET, elevated blood levels and associated symptoms may return rapidly because of redistribution of lead from bone stores to soft tissues and blood. Assess blood lead concentration after the completion of a 19 day course and every week until stable. Repeated courses may be administered after two weeks off treatment if blood lead concentrations remain elevated. A minimum of two weeks between treatment courses is recommended unless blood lead concentrations indicate the need for more prompt treatment. Table 1. CHEMET Pediatric Dosing Chart Weight in Kilograms (kg) Dose (mg) Number of Capsules 8 to15 kg 100 mg 1 16 to 23 kg 200 mg 2 24 to 34 kg 300 mg 3 35 to 44 kg 400 mg 4 >45 kg 500 mg 5 The safety of uninterrupted dosing longer than 3 weeks has not been established and is not recommended. Dosage Modifications for Neutropenia Monitor CBCs weekly. If the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is <1200/mcL interrupt CHEMET. Resume CHEMET when ANC has recovered to >1500/mcL (or the patient's baseline count). Immediately discontinue CHEMET for signs/symptoms of infection. Only rechallenge patients who developed neutropenia with CHEMET therapy if the benefit clearly outweighs the potential risk. 2.3 Preparation and Administration Instructions Administer CHEMET capsules whole. In pediatric patients who cannot swallow the capsules whole, separate the capsule and sprinkle the medicated beads on a small amount of soft food or put them in a spoon and follow with a fruit drink. Ensure that all patients receiving CHEMET are adequately hydrated [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) , Pharmacokinetics (12.3) ] ."
