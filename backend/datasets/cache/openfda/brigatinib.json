    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS CYP3A Inhibitors : Avoid coadministration of ALUNBRIG with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors. If coadministration of a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor is unavoidable, reduce the dose of ALUNBRIG. ( 2.4 , 7.1 ) CYP3A Inducers : Avoid coadministration of ALUNBRIG with strong or moderate CYP3A inducers. If coadministration of a moderate CYP3A inducer is unavoidable, increase the dose of ALUNBRIG. ( 2.5 , 7.1 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on ALUNBRIG Strong or Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors Coadministration of ALUNBRIG with a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor increased brigatinib plasma concentrations, which may increase the incidence of adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Avoid coadministration of ALUNBRIG with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors. If coadministration of strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors cannot be avoided, modify dose as recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . Strong or Moderate CYP3A Inducers Coadministration of ALUNBRIG with a strong or moderate CYP3A inducer decreased brigatinib plasma concentrations, which may decrease the efficacy of ALUNBRIG [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Avoid coadministration of ALUNBRIG with strong or moderate CYP3A inducers.

( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Takeda Pharmaceuticals at 1-844-217-6468 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Advanced ALK-positive NSCLC Without Prior ALK-targeted Therapy In ALTA 1L, the safety of ALUNBRIG was evaluated in 136 patients with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC who had not previously received an ALK-targeted therapy [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . The median duration of treatment with ALUNBRIG when administered as 90 mg orally once daily for the first 7 days; then increased to 180 mg orally once daily, was 24.3 months. A total of 106 (78%) patients were exposed to ALUNBRIG for greater than or equal to 6 months including 92 (68%) patients exposed for greater than or equal to 1 year. The median relative dose intensity was 97% for ALUNBRIG. The study population (N = 275) characteristics were: median age 59 years (range: 27 to 89), age less than 65 years (68%), female (55%), White (59%), Asian (39%), Stage IV disease (93%), NSCLC adenocarcinoma histology (96%), never smoker (58%), ECOG Performance Status (PS) 0 or 1 (95%), and CNS metastases at baseline (30%) [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Serious adverse reactions occurred in 33% of patients receiving ALUNBRIG. The most common serious adverse reactions were pneumonia (4.4%), ILD/pneumonitis (3.7%), pyrexia (2.9%), dyspnea (2.2%), pulmonary embolism (2.2%), and asthenia (2.2%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 2.9% of patients and included pneumonia (1.5%), cerebrovascular accident (0.7%), and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (0.7%). In ALTA 1L, 13% of patients receiving ALUNBRIG permanently discontinued ALUNBRIG for adverse reactions. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to discontinuation were ILD/pneumonitis (3.7%) and pneumonia (2.2%). In ALTA 1L, 38% of patients required a dose reduction due to adverse reactions. The most common adverse reaction that led to dose reduction was increased creatine phosphokinase (15%), increased lipase (6.6%), increased amylase (4.4%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (2.2%), ILD/pneumonitis (2.2%) and hypertension (2.2%).

ALK-positive Advanced or Metastatic NSCLC Previously Treated with Crizotinib The safety of ALUNBRIG was evaluated in 219 patients with locally advanced or metastatic ALK-positive NSCLC who received at least 1 dose of ALUNBRIG in ALTA after experiencing disease progression on crizotinib. Patients received ALUNBRIG 90 mg once daily continuously (90 mg group) or 90 mg once daily for 7 days followed by 180 mg once daily (90\u2192180 mg group). The median duration of treatment was 7.5 months in the 90 mg group and 7.8 months in the 90\u2192180 mg group. A total of 150 (68%) patients were exposed to ALUNBRIG for greater than or equal to 6 months and 42 (19%) patients were exposed for greater than or equal to 1 year. The study population (N = 222) characteristics were: median age 54 years (range: 18 to 82), age less than 65 years (77%), female (57%), White (67%), Asian (31%), Stage IV disease (98%), NSCLC adenocarcinoma histology (97%), never or former smoker (95%), ECOG Performance Status (PS) 0 or 1 (93%), and CNS metastases at baseline (69%) [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Serious adverse reactions occurred in 38% of patients in the 90 mg group and 40% of patients in the 90\u2192180 mg group. The most common serious adverse reactions were pneumonia (5.5% overall, 3.7% in the 90 mg group, and 7.3% in the 90\u2192180 mg group) and ILD/pneumonitis (4.6% overall, 1.8% in the 90 mg group and 7.3% in the 90\u2192180 mg group). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 3.7% of patients and consisted of pneumonia (2 patients), sudden death, dyspnea, respiratory failure, pulmonary embolism, bacterial meningitis and urosepsis (1 patient each). In ALTA, 2.8% of patients in the 90 mg group and 8.2% of patients in the 90\u2192180 mg group permanently discontinued ALUNBRIG for adverse reactions. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to discontinuation were ILD/pneumonitis (0.9% in the 90 mg group and 1.8% in the 90\u2192180 mg group) and pneumonia (1.8% in the 90\u2192180 mg group only). In ALTA, 14% of patients required a dose reduction due to adverse reactions (7.3% in the 90 mg group and 20% in the 90\u2192180 mg group). The most common adverse reaction that led to dose reduction was increased creatine phosphokinase for both regimens (1.8% in the 90 mg group and 4.5% in the 90\u2192180 mg group).

    "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 90 mg orally once daily for the first 7 days; then increase to 180 mg orally once daily. May be taken with or without food. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Patient Selection Select patients for the treatment of metastatic NSCLC with ALUNBRIG based on the presence of ALK positivity in tumor specimens [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Information on FDA-approved tests for the detection of ALK rearrangements in NSCLC is available at http://www.fda.gov/CompanionDiagnostics. 2.2 Recommended Dosage The recommended dosage for ALUNBRIG is: 90 mg orally once daily for the first 7 days; then increase the dose to 180 mg orally once daily. Administer ALUNBRIG until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. If ALUNBRIG is interrupted for 14 days or longer for reasons other than adverse reactions, resume treatment at 90 mg once daily for 7 days before increasing to the previously tolerated dose. ALUNBRIG may be taken with or without food. Instruct patients to swallow tablets whole. Do not crush or chew tablets. If a dose of ALUNBRIG is missed or vomiting occurs after taking a dose, do not administer an additional dose and take the next dose of ALUNBRIG at the scheduled time. 2.3 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions ALUNBRIG dosage reductions for adverse reactions are summarized in Table 1.

If coadministration of a strong CYP3A inhibitor cannot be avoided, reduce the ALUNBRIG once daily dose by approximately 50% (i.e., from 180 mg to 90 mg, or from 90 mg to 60 mg). If coadministration of a moderate CYP3A inhibitor cannot be avoided, reduce the ALUNBRIG once daily dose by approximately 40% (i.e., from 180 mg to 120 mg, 120 mg to 90 mg, or from 90 mg to 60 mg).

If coadministration of a moderate CYP3A inducer cannot be avoided, increase the ALUNBRIG once daily dose in 30 mg increments after 7 days of treatment with the current ALUNBRIG dose as tolerated, up to a maximum of twice the ALUNBRIG dose that was tolerated prior to initiating the moderate CYP3A inducer. After discontinuation of a moderate CYP3A inducer, resume the ALUNBRIG dose that was tolerated prior to initiating the moderate CYP3A inducer. 2.6 Dosage Modifications for Patients with Severe Hepatic Impairment Reduce the ALUNBRIG once daily dose by approximately 40% (i.e., from 180 mg to 120 mg, 120 mg to 90 mg, or from 90 mg to 60 mg) for patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.7 Dosage Modifications for Patients with Severe Renal Impairment Reduce the ALUNBRIG once daily dose by approximately 50% (i.e., from 180 mg to 90 mg, or from 90 mg to 60 mg) for patients with severe renal impairment [creatinine clearance (CLcr) 15 to 29 mL/min by Cockcroft-Gault] [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."
