    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022 Strong CYP3A Inducers: Contraindicated. ( 2.4 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Moderate CYP3A Inducers: Avoid concomitant use. If coadministration cannot be avoided, increase the LORBRENA dose. ( 2.5 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Strong CYP3A Inhibitors: Avoid concomitant use; reduce LORBRENA dose if concomitant use cannot be avoided. ( 2.6 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Fluconazole : Avoid concomitant use; reduce LORBRENA dose if concomitant use cannot be avoided. ( 2.7 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Certain CYP3A Substrates: Avoid concomitant use with CYP3A substrates for which minimal concentration changes may lead to serious therapeutic failures. ( 7.2 ) \u2022 Certain P-gp Substrates: Avoid concomitant use with P-gp substrates for which minimal concentration changes may lead to serious therapeutic failures. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on LORBRENA Strong CYP3A Inducers Concomitant use of LORBRENA with a strong CYP3A inducer decreased lorlatinib plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] , which may decrease the efficacy of LORBRENA. Severe hepatotoxicity occurred in healthy subjects receiving LORBRENA with rifampin, a strong CYP3A inducer. In 12 healthy subjects receiving a single 100 mg dose of LORBRENA with multiple daily doses of rifampin, Grade 3 or 4 increases in ALT or AST occurred in 83% of subjects and Grade 2 increases in ALT or AST occurred in 8%. A possible mechanism for hepatotoxicity is through activation of the pregnane X receptor (PXR) by LORBRENA and rifampin, which are both PXR agonists. LORBRENA is contraindicated in patients taking strong CYP3A inducers [see Contraindication (4) ] . Discontinue strong CYP3A inducers for 3 plasma half-lives of the strong CYP3A inducer prior to initiating LORBRENA [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Moderate CYP3A Inducers Concomitant use of LORBRENA with a moderate CYP3A inducer decreased lorlatinib plasma concentrations, which may decrease the efficacy of LORBRENA [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Avoid concomitant use of moderate CYP3A inducers with LORBRENA. If concomitant use is unavoidable, increase the LORBRENA dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Concomitant use with a strong CYP3A inhibitor increased lorlatinib plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ], which may increase the incidence and severity of adverse reactions of LORBRENA. Avoid concomitant use of LORBRENA with a strong CYP3A inhibitor. If concomitant use cannot be avoided, reduce the LORBRENA dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . Fluconazole Concomitant use of LORBRENA with fluconazole may increase lorlatinib plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] , which may increase the incidence and severity of adverse reactions of LORBRENA. Avoid concomitant use of LORBRENA with fluconazole. If concomitant use cannot be avoided, reduce the LORBRENA dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . 7.2 Effect of LORBRENA on Other Drugs Certain CYP3A Substrates LORBRENA is a moderate CYP3A inducer. Concomitant use of LORBRENA decreases the concentration of CYP3A substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] , which may reduce the efficacy of these substrates. Avoid concomitant use of LORBRENA with certain CYP3A substrates, for which minimal concentration changes may lead to serious therapeutic failures. If concomitant use is unavoidable, increase the CYP3A substrate dosage in accordance with approved product labeling. Certain P-glycoprotein (P-gp) Substrates LORBRENA is a moderate P-gp inducer. Concomitant use of LORBRENA decreases the concentration of P-gp substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] , which may reduce the efficacy of these substrates. Avoid concomitant use of LORBRENA with certain P-gp substrates for which minimal concentration changes may lead to serious therapeutic failures. If concomitant use is unavoidable, increase the P-gp substrate dosage in accordance with approved product labeling."

The pooled safety population described in the Warnings and Precautions section reflects exposure to LORBRENA in 476 patients who received 100 mg LORBRENA once daily in Study B7461001 (N=327) and Study B7461006 (N=149). Among 476 patients who received LORBRENA, 75% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 61% were exposed for greater than 1 year. In this pooled safety population, the most frequent adverse reactions in \u2265 20% of 476 patients who received LORBRENA were edema (56%), peripheral neuropathy (44%), weight gain (31%), cognitive effects (28%), fatigue (27%), dyspnea (27%), arthralgia (24%), diarrhea (23%), mood effects (21%), and cough (21%). The most frequent Grade 3\u20134 laboratory abnormalities in \u2265 20% of 476 patients who received LORBRENA were hypercholesterolemia (21%) and hypertriglyceridemia (21%). Previously Untreated ALK-Positive Metastatic NSCLC (CROWN Study) The safety of LORBRENA was evaluated in 149 patients with ALK-positive NSCLC in a randomized, open-label, active-controlled trial for the treatment of patients with ALK-positive, locally advanced or metastatic, NSCLC who had not received previous systemic treatment for advanced disease [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. The median duration of exposure to LORBRENA was 16.7 months (4 days to 34.3 months) and 76% received LORBRENA for at least 12 months. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 34% of patients treated with LORBRENA; the most frequently reported serious adverse reactions were pneumonia (4.7%), dyspnea (2.7%), respiratory failure (2.7%), cognitive effects (2.0%), and pyrexia (2.0%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 3.4% of patients treated with LORBRENA and included pneumonia (0.7%), respiratory failure (0.7%), cardiac failure acute (0.7%), pulmonary embolism (0.7%), and sudden death (0.7%). Permanent discontinuation of LORBRENA due to adverse reactions occurred in 6.7% of patients. The most frequent adverse reaction that led to permanent discontinuation of LORBRENA was cognitive effects (1.3%). Adverse reactions leading to dose interruptions occurred in 49% of patients treated with LORBRENA. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to dose interruptions of LORBRENA were hypertriglyceridemia (7%), edema (5%), pneumonia (4.7%) cognitive effects (4.0%), mood effects (4.0%), and hypercholesterolemia (3.4%). Adverse reactions leading to dose reductions occurred in 21% of patients treated with LORBRENA. The most frequent adverse reactions that led to dose reductions were edema (5%), hypertriglyceridemia (4.0%), and peripheral neuropathy (3.4%).

    "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended dosage: 100 mg orally once daily. ( 2.2 ) Severe Renal Impairment: 75 mg orally once daily. ( 2.8 , 8.7 , 12.3 ) 2.1 Patient Selection Select patients for the treatment of metastatic NSCLC with LORBRENA based on the presence of ALK positivity in tumor specimens [see Indications and Usage (1) and Clinical Studies (14) ] . Information on FDA-approved tests for the detection of ALK rearrangements in NSCLC is available at http://www.fda.gov/CompanionDiagnostics . 2.2 Recommended Dosage The recommended dosage of LORBRENA is 100 mg orally once daily, with or without food, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Swallow tablets whole. Do not chew, crush or split tablets. Do not ingest if tablets are broken, cracked, or otherwise not intact. Take LORBRENA at the same time each day. If a dose is missed, then take the missed dose unless the next dose is due within 4 hours. Do not take 2 doses at the same time to make up for a missed dose. Do not take an additional dose if vomiting occurs after LORBRENA but continue with the next scheduled dose. 2.3 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions The recommended dose reductions are: \u2022 First dose reduction: LORBRENA 75 mg orally once daily \u2022 Second dose reduction: LORBRENA 50 mg orally once daily Permanently discontinue LORBRENA in patients who are unable to tolerate 50 mg orally once daily. Dosage modifications for adverse reactions of LORBRENA are provided in Table 1.
