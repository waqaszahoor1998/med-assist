    "7 D RUG I NTERACTIONS Ibrexafungerp is a substrate of CYP3A4. Drugs that inhibit or induce CYP3A may alter the plasma concentrations of ibrexafungerp and affect the safety and efficacy of BREXAFEMME [see Clinical P harmacology ( 12.3 ) ] Table 3 Effect of Coadministered Drugs on Ibrexafungerp Pharmacokinetics: Concomitant Drug s Effect on Ibrexafungerp Concentration Recommendation Strong CYP3A inhibitors: (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole) Significantly increased Reduce the BREXAFEMME dosage [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ] Strong and Moderate CYP3A inducers: (e.g., rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John\u2019s wort, long acting barbiturates, bosentan, efavirenz, or etravirine) Not studied in vivo or in vitro, but likely to result in significant reduction Avoid concomitant administration Ibrexafungerp is an inhibitor of CYP3A4, P-gp and OATP1B3 transporter [(see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . However, given the short treatment duration for VVC, the effect of BREXAFEMME on the pharmacokinetics of substrates of CYP3A4, P-gp and OATP1B3 transporters is not considered to be clinically significant. Concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors increases the exposure of ibrexafungerp. Reduce BREXAFEMME dose with concomitant use of a strong CYP3A inhibitor to 150 mg twice daily for one day. ( 2.2 , 7 ) Concomitant use of strong and moderate CYP3A inducers may significantly reduce the exposure of ibrexafungerp. Avoid concomitant administration of BREXAFEMME with strong or moderate CYP3A inducers. ( 7 )"

    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Treatment of VVC: The most frequent adverse reactions (incidence \u2265 2%) reported were diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, dizziness, and vomiting. ( 6.1 ) Reduction in the incidence of RVVC: The most frequent adverse reactions (incidence \u2265 2%) reported were headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, urinary tract infection and fatigue. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact SCYNEXIS, Inc. at 1-888-982-7299 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Treatment of VVC A total of 545 patients were exposed to BREXAFEMME in two clinical trials of post-menarchal females with VVC (Trial 1 and Trial 2). The patients were treated with BREXAFEMME 300 mg (two 150 mg tablets) twice a day, 12 hours apart, for one day. The patients were 18 to 76 years of age (mean 34 years); 69% were White and 28% were Black or African American; 18% were of Hispanic or Latina ethnicity. The most frequently reported adverse reactions are presented in Table 1. There were no serious adverse reactions and 2 out of 545 (0.4%) patients discontinued treatment with BREXAFEMME due to vomiting (1 patient) and dizziness (1 patient). Table 1.

Reduction in the Incidence of RVVC A total of 130 patients were exposed to BREXAFEMME in a clinical trial of post-menarchal females with RVVC (Trial 3). The patients were treated with BREXAFEMME 300 mg (two 150 mg tablets) twice a day, 12 hours apart, for one day, monthly for six consecutive months. The patients were 18 to 65 years of age (mean 34 years), of which, 59% of patients were between 18 to 35 years, and 41% between 36 to 65 years. Ninety two percent (92%) were White, 7% were Black or African American, and 1% were Asian. Nine percent (9%) of patients were of Hispanic or Latina ethnicity. The most frequently reported adverse reactions are presented in Table 2. There were no serious adverse reactions and no patients discontinued treatment with BREXAFEMME due to adverse reaction.
