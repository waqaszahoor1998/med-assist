    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS QTc Interval Prolongation Drugs: Avoid concomitant use with ZOKINVY. ( 2.2 , 5.2 , 7.1 , 12.3 ) See full prescribing information for additional clinically significant drug interactions with ZOKINVY and recommended dosage modifications for drug interactions. ( 2.2 , 7 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on ZOKINVY Table 5 presents clinically significant drug interactions involving drugs that affect ZOKINVY. Table 5: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions (Drugs that Affect ZOKINVY) CYP3A Inhibitors Clinical Impact Lonafarnib is metabolized by CYP3A. Concomitant use of ZOKINVY with a strong CYP3A inhibitor may increase lonafarnib area under curve (AUC) and maximum concentration (C max ) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , which may increase the incidence and severity of adverse reactions, including QTc interval prolongation. Prolongation of the QTc interval increases the risk of Torsade de pointes, other serious arrhythmias, and sudden death [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Prevention or Management Strong CYP3A inhibitors Use of ZOKINVY with strong CYP3A inhibitors is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . Avoid consumption of grapefruit or Seville oranges. Moderate CYP3A inhibitors No dosage adjustment for ZOKINVY is recommended when moderate CYP3A inhibitors are added to steady-state ZOKINVY [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . When initiating ZOKINVY in a patient who is currently on a moderate CYP3A inhibitor, the patient may be at increased risk of adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . CYP3A Inducers Clinical Impact Coadministration of ZOKINVY with a strong CYP3A inducer decreases lonafarnib C max and AUC [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , which may reduce ZOKINVY efficacy. Prevention or Management Strong or moderate CYP3A inducers Use of ZOKINVY with strong or moderate CYP3A inducers is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . Weak CYP3A inducers No ZOKINVY dosage adjustment is recommended. QTc Prolongation Drugs Clinical Implication ZOKINVY causes QTc interval prolongation [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )] . Concomitant use of ZOKINVY with other products that prolong the QTc interval may result in a greater increase of the QTc interval and adverse reactions associated with QTc interval prolongation, including Torsade de pointes, other serious arrythmias, and sudden death [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Prevention or Management Avoid concomitant use of ZOKINVY with other drugs with a known potential to prolong the QTc interval. If concomitant use cannot be avoided, obtain ECGs when initiating, during concomitant use, and as clinically indicated [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . 7.2 ZOKINVY\u2019s Effect on Other Drugs Table 6 presents clinically significant drug interactions involving drugs affected by ZOKINVY. Table 6: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions (Drugs Affected by ZOKINVY) CYP3A Substrates Clinical Impact Lonafarnib is a strong CYP3A mechanism-based inhibitor. Coadministration of ZOKINVY with a CYP3A substrate increases the AUC and C max of the CYP3A substrate [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] which may increase the risk of the CYP3A substrate\u2019s adverse reactions, including myopathy or rhabdomyolysis (with statins), or extreme sedation or respiratory depression (with midazolam). Prevention or Management HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (\u201cStatins\u201d) Coadministration of ZOKINVY with lovastatin, simvastatin, or atorvastatin is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . Midazolam Coadministration of ZOKINVY with midazolam is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . Temporarily discontinue ZOKINVY for 10-14 days before and 2 days after administration of midazolam [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . Other sensitive CYP3A substrates Avoid coadministration of ZOKINVY with sensitive CYP3A substrates. As noted above, use with lovastatin, simvastatin, or atorvastatin, and midazolam is contraindicated [see Contraindications ( 4 )] ). If coadministration of 11 other sensitive CYP3A substrates is unavoidable, monitor for adverse reactions and reduce the dosage of those sensitive CYP3A substrate(s) in accordance with their approved product labeling. Certain CYP3A substrates When ZOKINVY is coadministered with certain CYP3A substrates where minimal concentration changes may lead to serious or life-threatening toxicities, monitor for adverse reactions and reduce the dosage of the CYP3A substrate in accordance with its approved product labeling. Loperamide Clinical Impact Lonafarnib is a weak inhibitor of P-gp and strong inhibitor of CYP3A. Coadministration of ZOKINVY with loperamide increases the AUC and C max of loperamide [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] which may increase the risk of loperamide\u2019s adverse reactions. Prevention or Management Loperamide is contraindicated in patients less than 2 years of age. When ZOKINVY is coadministered with loperamide, do not exceed loperamide 1 mg once daily when first coadministered. Slowly increase loperamide dosage with caution in accordance with its approved product labeling. CYP2C19 Substrates Clinical Impact Lonafarnib is a moderate CYP2C19 inhibitor. Coadministration of ZOKINVY with a CYP2C19 substrate increases the AUC and C max of the CYP2C19 substrate [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] which may increase the risk of the CYP2C19 substrate\u2019s adverse reactions. Prevention or Management Avoid coadministration of ZOKINVY with CYP2C19 substrates. If coadministration is unavoidable, monitor for adverse reactions and reduce the dosage of the CYP2C19 substrate in accordance with its approved product labeling. P-gp Substrates Clinical Impact Lonafarnib is a weak P-gp inhibitor. Coadministration of ZOKINVY with a P-gp substrate increases the AUC and C max of the P-gp substrate [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] , which may increase the risk of the P-gp substrate\u2019s adverse reactions. Prevention or Management When ZOKINVY is coadministered with P-gp substrates (e.g., digoxin, dabigatran) where minimal concentration changes may lead to serious or life-threatening toxicities, monitor for adverse reactions and reduce the dosage of the P-gp substrate in accordance with its approved product labeling."

    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (incidence \u226525%) are vomiting, diarrhea, infection, nausea, decreased appetite, fatigue, upper respiratory tract infection, abdominal pain, musculoskeletal pain, electrolyte abnormalities, decreased weight, headache, myelosuppression, increased aspartate aminotransferase, decreased blood bicarbonate, cough, hypertension, and increased alanine aminotransferase. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Eiger BioPharmaceuticals, Inc. at 833-267-0545 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. A total of 84 subjects were treated with at least one dose of ZOKINVY with or without additional therapy, of which 8 were treated at a dosage of at least 115 mg/m 2 twice daily for greater than or equal to 10 years. The safety profile of ZOKINVY is based on 128 patient-years of treatment exposure (62 patients with HGPS and 1 patient with processing-deficient Progeroid Laminopathy with LMNA heterozygous mutation) and pooled results from two Phase 2 open-label, single-arm trials (n=63: 28 patients from Study 1 and 35 treatment na\u00efve patients from Study 2). In Study 1, ZOKINVY treatment was initiated at 115 mg/m 2 twice daily and increased to 150 mg/m 2 twice daily after approximately 4 months for a total treatment duration of 24 to 30 months. Treatment na\u00efve patients in Study 2 received ZOKINVY 150 mg/m 2 twice daily for up to 36 months. In both studies, ZOKINVY was administered orally via capsules or the capsule contents were mixed with Ora Blend SF or Ora-Plus and administered orally as a suspension. In these two studies, a total of 63 patients received ZOKINVY for a median duration of 2.2 years, with approximately 1.9 years at the recommended dose of 150 mg/m 2 twice daily. The population was 2 to 17 years old, with a similar proportion of males (33 [52%] patients) and females (30 [48%] patients). Most patients had classic HGPS (60 [95%] patients) compared to non-classic HGPS (2 [3%] patients) and 1 (2%) patient had Progeroid Laminopathy with LMNA heterozygous mutation. Table 4 summarizes adverse reactions reported in the clinical trials. The most common adverse reactions (\u226525%) in the clinical trials were vomiting, diarrhea, infection, nausea, decreased appetite, fatigue, upper respiratory tract infection, abdominal pain, musculoskeletal pain, electrolyte abnormalities, decreased weight, headache, myelosuppression, increased aspartate aminotransferase, decreased blood bicarbonate, cough, hypertension, and increased alanine aminotransferase.

Of the 57 patients who experienced vomiting, 30 (53%) patients had mild vomiting (defined as no intervention required), 26 (46%) patients had moderate vomiting (defined as outpatient intravenous hydration; medical intervention required), and 1 (2%) patient had severe vomiting (defined as tube feeding, total parenteral nutrition, or hospitalization indicated). Of the 35 patients who experienced nausea, 34 (97%) patients had mild nausea (defined as loss of appetite without alteration in eating habits) and 1 (3%) patient had moderate nausea (defined as oral intake decreased without significant weight loss, dehydration, or malnutrition). During the first four months of treatment in Study 1, 19 (68%) patients had vomiting and 10 (36%) patients had nausea. By the end of therapy, 4 (14%) patients who were still on ZOKINVY required antiemetics or anti-nauseants. A total of 4 patients discontinued ZOKINVY, mostly due to nausea or vomiting. Of the 51 patients who experienced diarrhea, the majority of patients (approximately 92%) experienced mild or moderate diarrhea; 38 (75%) patients reported mild diarrhea (defined as an increase of less than 4 stools per day over baseline) and 9 (18%) patients reported moderate diarrhea (defined as increase of 4 to 6 stools per day over baseline; limiting instrumental activities of daily living). Four (8%) patients reported severe diarrhea (defined as increase of seven or more stools per day over baseline; hospitalization indicated; severe increase in ostomy output compared to baseline; limiting self-care activities of daily living). During the first four months of treatment in Study 1, 23 (82%) patients had diarrhea; by the end of therapy, 3 (11%) patients had diarrhea. Twelve (43%) patients were treated with loperamide. Alanine Aminotransferase and Aspartate Aminotransferase Elevations Increased alanine aminotransferase was commonly reported (17 [27%] patients). Of the 17 patients with increased alanine aminotransferase, 14 (82%) patients had mild increases (defined as greater than upper limit of normal (ULN) to 3.0 times ULN if baseline was normal; 1.5 to 3.0 times ULN if baseline was abnormal), 1 (6%) patient had moderate increases (defined as greater than 3.0 to 5.0 times ULN if baseline was normal or abnormal), and 2 (12%) patients had severe increases (defined as greater than 5.0 to 20.0 times ULN if baseline was normal or abnormal). Increased aspartate aminotransferase was also commonly reported (22 [35%] patients). Of the 22 patients with increased aspartate aminotransferase, 21 (95%) patients had mild increases (defined as greater than ULN to 3.0 times ULN if baseline was normal; 1.5 to 3.0 times ULN if baseline was abnormal) and 1 (5%) patient had a severe increase (defined as greater than 5.0 to 20.0 times ULN if baseline was normal or abnormal). One patient with alanine and aspartate aminotransferase elevations also experienced hypertriglyceridemia and hyperglycemia resulting in discontinuation of ZOKINVY. Hypertension Increases in blood pressure have been documented in patients treated with ZOKINVY. At baseline, 22 (35%) patients had either a systolic blood pressure or a diastolic blood pressure or both above the 95th percentile. Over the course of the trials, 18 (29%) patients had hypertension based on systolic blood pressure or diastolic blood pressure measurements above the 95th percentile on 3 or more occasions. Five (8%) patients who were normotensive at baseline had either systolic blood pressure or diastolic blood pressure above the 95th percentile at the end of treatment."
