    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The dose of FANAPT should be reduced in patients co-administered a strong CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitor. ( 2.2 , 7.1 ) 7.1 Clinically Important Drug Interactions with FANAPT Table 7 presents clinically important drug interactions with FANAPT. Table 7: Clinically Important Drug Interactions with FANAPT Strong CYP2D6 Inhibitors Clinical Impact Coadministration of fluoxetine with iloperidone increased exposure (area under curve, [AUC]) of iloperidone and its metabolite P88, by about 2- to 3- fold, and decreased the AUC of its metabolite P95 by one-half [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3 , 12.5) ] . Coadministration of paroxetine with iloperidone resulted in increased mean steady-state peak concentrations of iloperidone and its metabolite P88, by about 1.6- fold, and decreased mean steady-state peak concentrations of its metabolite P95 by one-half [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3 , 12.5) ] . Intervention Reduce the dose of FANAPT by one-half when administered with strong CYP2D6 inhibitors. When a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy, the iloperidone dose should be returned to the previous level [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Clinical Impact Co-administration of ketoconazole with iloperidone, increased the AUC of iloperidone and its metabolites P88 and P95 by 57%, 55%, and 35%, respectively [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Intervention Reduce the dose of FANAPT by one-half when administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. When the CYP3A4 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy, the FANAPT dose should be returned to the previous level [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . Concomitant use of Strong CYP2D6 and Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Clinical Impact Coadministration of iloperidone with paroxetine and ketoconazole resulted in a 1.4- fold increase in steady-state concentrations of iloperidone and its metabolite P88 and a 1.4- fold decrease in the P95 in the presence of paroxetine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Intervention Coadministration of FANAPT with inhibitors of both CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 did not add to the effect of either inhibitor given alone. Reduce the dose of FANAPT by about one-half if administered concomitantly with both a CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 inhibitor same as if it is coadministered with only one inhibitor. When the inhibitors of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 are withdrawn from the combination therapy, the FANAPT dose should be returned to the previous level [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . 7.2 Drugs that Prolong the QT Interval Concomitant use of drugs that prolong the QT interval may add to the QT effects of FANAPT and increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmia. Avoid the use of FANAPT in combination with any other drugs that prolong the QT interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . 7.3 Drugs that Lower Blood Pressure Concomitant use of FANAPT with medications that lower blood pressure could potentially cause symptomatic hypotension. Avoid coadministration of FANAPT with alpha-adrenergic blocking agents and adjust medications that affect blood pressure as needed [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] ."

The information below is derived from a clinical trial database for FANAPT consisting of 3,229 patients exposed to FANAPT at doses of 10 mg/day or greater, for the treatment of schizophrenia and from a clinical trial database for FANAPT consisting of 312 patients exposed to FANAPT at doses of 24 mg/day, for the treatment of bipolar mania [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Of these, 999 received FANAPT for at least 6 months, with 657 exposed to FANAPT for at least 12 months for the treatment of schizophrenia and 69 received FANAPT for at least 6 months, with 28 exposed to FANAPT for at least 12 months for the treatment of bipolar mania. All of these patients who received FANAPT were participating in multiple-dose clinical trials. The conditions and duration of treatment with FANAPT varied greatly and included (in overlapping categories), open-label and double-blind phases of studies, inpatients and outpatients, fixed-dose and flexible-dose studies, and short-term and longer-term exposure. Schizophrenia The information presented in this section was derived from pooled data from 4 placebo-controlled, 4- or 6-week, fixed- or flexible-dose studies in patients who received FANAPT at daily doses within a range of 10 to 24 mg (n=874). Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of 2% or More among FANAPT-Treated Patients and More Frequent than Placebo Table 3 enumerates the pooled incidences of adverse reactions that were spontaneously reported in four placebo-controlled, 4- or 6-week, fixed- or flexible-dose studies, listing those reactions that occurred in 2% or more of patients treated with FANAPT in any of the dose groups, and for which the incidence in FANAPT- treated patients in any dose group was greater than the incidence in patients treated with placebo. Table 3: Percentage of Adverse Reactions in Short-Term, Fixed- or Flexible-Dose, Placebo- Controlled Schizophrenia Trials in Adult Patients* * Table includes adverse reactions that were reported in 2% or more of patients in any of the FANAPT dose groups and which occurred at greater incidence than in the placebo group.

Common and Drug-Related Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials Based on the pooled data from 4 placebo-controlled, 4- or 6-week, fixed- or flexible-dose studies of patients with schizophrenia, the following adverse reactions occurred in \u22655% incidence in the patients treated with FANAPT and at least twice the placebo rate for at least 1 dose: dizziness, dry mouth, fatigue, nasal congestion, somnolence, tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension, and weight increased. Dizziness, tachycardia, and weight increased were at least twice as common on 20-24 mg/day as on 10-16 mg/day. In a short-term, placebo-controlled trial in patients with bipolar mania the following adverse reactions occurred in \u22655% incidence in the patients treated with FANAPT and at least twice the placebo rate: tachycardia, dizziness, dry mouth, hepatic enzymes increased, nasal congestion, weight increased, hypotension, and somnolence. Extrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS) in Clinical Trials Pooled data from the 4 placebo-controlled, 4- or 6-week, fixed- or flexible-dose studies of patients with schizophrenia provided information regarding EPS. Adverse event data collected from those trials showed the following rates of EPS-related adverse events as shown in Table 5 . Table 5: Percentage of EPS Compared to Placebo in 4- or 6-week Schizophrenia Trials Placebo (%) FANAPT 10-16 mg/day (%) FANAPT 20-24 mg/day (%) Preferred Term (N=587) (N=483) (N=391) All EPS events 11.6 13.5 15.1 Tremor 1.9 2.5 3.1 Akathisia 2.7 1.7 2.3 Dyskinesia 1.5 1.7 1 Dystonia 0.7 1 0.8 Bradykinesia 0 0.6 0.5 Parkinsonism 0 0.2 0.3 Table 6 shows the rates of EPS-related events in a 4-week bipolar mania trial.

Preferred Term Placebo (%) FANAPT 24 mg/day * (%) N=208 N=206 All EPS events 0 8.3 Akathisia 0 4.4 Extrapyramidal Disorder 0 1 Blepharospasm 0 0.5 Dystonia 0 0.5 Muscle Spasm 0 0.5 Restlessness 0 0.5 Torticollis 0 0.5 Tremor 0 0.5 Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment in Clinical Trials Based on the pooled data from 4 placebo-controlled, 4- or 6-week, fixed- or flexible-dose studies in patients with schizophrenia, there was no difference in the incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions between FANAPT-treated (5%) and placebo-treated (5%) patients. The types of adverse reactions that led to discontinuation were similar for the FANAPT- and placebo-treated patients. In a 4-week, placebo-controlled study in patients with bipolar mania, the incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions was higher in FANAPT-treated (8.7%) patients than placebo-treated (5.3%) patients. Adverse reactions that led to discontinuation in more than one FANAPT-treated subject were liver enzyme elevations, nausea and vomiting, dizziness and hypotension. Demographic Differences in Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials An examination of population subgroups in the 4 placebo-controlled, 4- or 6-week, fixed- or flexible-dose studies of patients with schizophrenia did not reveal any evidence of differences in safety on the basis of age, sex or race. Laboratory Test Abnormalities in Clinical Trials There were no differences between FANAPT and placebo in the incidence of discontinuation due to changes in hematology, or urinalysis. Serum Transaminases In a short-term placebo-controlled trial, asymptomatic alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations \u22653x ULN occurred in 9.2% of FANAPT-treated patients with acute mania compared to 1.5% of placebo treated subjects. AST elevations were less common. Hematocrit In short-term placebo-controlled trials (4- to 6-weeks) in patients with schizophrenia, there were 1.0% (13/1342) FANAPT-treated patients with hematocrit at least one time below the extended normal range during post-randomization treatment, compared to 0.3% (2/585) on placebo. The extended normal range for lowered hematocrit was defined in each of these trials as the value 15% below the normal range for the centralized laboratory that was used in the trial. In a short-term placebo-controlled trial (4 weeks) in patients with bipolar mania, there were 3.5% (7/200) FANAPT-treated patients with hematocrit at least one time below the extended normal range (<0.85xLLN) during post-randomization treatment, compared to 0.5% (1/196) on placebo. Analysis of clinical laboratory data following administration of FANAPT suggested the mechanism of hemodilution based on consistent decreases in hematocrit, hemoglobin, white blood cells, total protein, and albumin. Decreases in hematocrit and total protein have been observed with other alpha receptor antagonists and are attributed to hemodilution [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ] Serum Urate Levels In a 4-week placebo-controlled trial in patients with bipolar mania, treatment with FANAPT 12 mg twice a day resulted in an increase of serum urate levels of approximately 27.2 umol/L (0.457 mg/dL) compared to 0.1 umol/L (0.002 mg/dL) in placebo group. Other Reactions During the Pre-marketing Evaluation of FANAPT Patients with Schizophrenia The following is a list of MedDRA terms that reflect adverse reactions in patients treated with FANAPT at multiple doses \u2265 4 mg/day during any phase of a trial with the database of 3,210 FANAPT-treated patients with schizophrenia. All reported reactions are included except those already listed in Table 3 , or other parts of the Adverse Reactions (6) , those considered in the Warnings and Precautions (5) , those reaction terms which were so general as to be uninformative, reactions reported in fewer than 3 patients and which were neither serious nor life-threatening, reactions that are otherwise common as background reactions, and reactions considered unlikely to be drug related. Reactions are further categorized by MedDRA system organ class and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: frequent adverse events are those occurring in at least 1/100 patients (only those not listed in Table 3 appear in this listing); infrequent adverse reactions are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients; rare events are those occurring in fewer than 1/1000 patients.
