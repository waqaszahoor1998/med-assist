    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS \u2022 Drugs Dependent on Gastric pH for Absorption: Systemic exposure of the concomitant drug may be significantly reduced leading to loss of efficacy. See full prescribing information for a list of interacting drugs. ( 7.1 ) \u2022 Tizanidine (CYP1A2) Substrate: Potential for substantial increases in blood concentrations of tizanidine resulting in hypotension, bradycardia or excessive drowsiness; avoid concomitant use, if possible. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Drugs Dependent on Gastric pH for Absorption Famotidine can reduce the absorption of other drugs, due to its effect on reducing intragastric acidity, leading to loss of efficacy of the concomitant drug. Concomitant administration of famotidine with dasatinib, delavirdine mesylate, cefditoren, and fosamprenavir is not recommended. See the prescribing information for other drugs dependent on gastric pH for absorption for administration instructions, including atazanavir, erlotinib, ketoconazole, itraconazole, ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, nilotinib, and rilpivirine. 7.2 Tizanidine (CYP1A2 Substrate) Although not studied clinically, famotidine is considered a weak CYP1A2 inhibitor and may lead to substantial increases in blood concentrations of tizanidine, a CYP1A2 substrate. Avoid concomitant use with famotidine. If concomitant use is necessary, monitor for hypotension, bradycardia or excessive drowsiness. Refer to the full prescribing information for tizanidine."

    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions are: headache, dizziness, constipation, and diarrhea. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Annora Pharma Private Limited at 1-866-495-1995 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Famotidine was studied in 7 US and international placebo- and active-controlled trials in approximately 2500 patients [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. A total of 1442 patients were treated with famotidine, including 302 treated with 40 mg twice daily, 456 treated with 20 mg twice daily, 461 treated with 40 mg once daily, and 396 treated with 20 mg once daily. The population was 17 to 91 years old, fairly well distributed between gender and race; however, the predominant race treated was Caucasian. The following adverse reactions occurred in greater than or equal to 1% of famotidine-treated patients: headache, dizziness and constipation. The following other adverse reactions were reported in less than 1% of patients in clinical trials: Body as a Whole: fever, asthenia, fatigue Cardiovascular: palpitations Gastrointestinal: elevated liver enzymes, vomiting, nausea, abdominal discomfort, anorexia, dry mouth Hematologic: thrombocytopenia Hypersensitivity: orbital edema, rash, conjunctival injection, bronchospasm Musculoskeletal: musculoskeletal pain, arthralgia Nervous System/Psychiatric: seizure, hallucinations, depression, anxiety, decreased libido, insomnia, somnolence Skin: pruritus, dry skin, flushing Special Senses: tinnitus, taste disorder Other: impotence 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of famotidine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiovascular: arrhythmia, AV block, prolonged QT interval Gastrointestinal: cholestatic jaundice, hepatitis Hematologic : agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, leukopenia Hypersensitivity: anaphylaxis, angioedema, facial edema, urticaria Musculoskeletal : rhabdomyolysis, muscle cramps Nervous System/Psychiatric: confusion, agitation, paresthesia Respiratory: interstitial pneumonia Skin: toxic epidermal necrolysis/Stevens-Johnson syndrome"

( 2.1 , 2.2 ) Administration ( 2.3 ): \u2022 Take once daily before bedtime or twice daily in the morning and before bedtime with or without food. 2.1 Recommended Dosage Table 1 shows the recommended dosage of famotidine 20 mg and 40 mg tablets in adult and pediatric patients weighing 40 kg and greater with normal renal function. The use of famotidine 20 mg and 40 mg tablets is not recommended in pediatric patients weighing less than 40 kg because the lowest available strength (20 mg) exceeds the recommended dose for these patients. Use another famotidine formulation for pediatric patients weighing less than 40 kg.

For patients who do not heal after 4 weeks, consider an additional 2 to 4 weeks of treatment [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )]. c Longer treatment durations have not been studied in clinical trials [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 , 14.2 , 14.3 )]. d In pediatric patients, the safety and effectiveness of famotidine tablets have not been established for the reduction of the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence or for treatment of pathological hypersecretory conditions [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. 2.2 Dosage in Renal Impairment Dosage adjustments of famotidine tablets are recommended for patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 60 mL/min) [see Use in Specific Populations 8.6 )] . Table 2 shows the recommended maximum dosage of famotidine 20 mg or 40 mg tablets for patients with renal impairment, by indication. Use the lowest effective dose. Some dosage adjustments may require switching to other formulations of famotidine (e.g., oral suspension, lower dose tablet).

Since 20 mg or 40 mg tablet strength cannot be used for this dosage regimen, use an alternate famotidine formulation. b Dosage adjustments for renal impairment are provided for both dosing regimens (20 mg twice daily and 40 mg twice daily) which showed effectiveness for the treatment of erosive esophagitis in clinical trials [see Clinical Studies ( 14.4 )]. c In pediatric patients, the safety and effectiveness of famotidine tablets have not been established for the reduction of the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence or for treatment of pathological hypersecretory conditions [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. d Doses required to treat pathological hypersecretory conditions may exceed the maximum doses evaluated in patients with impaired renal function. The risk for increased adverse reactions in renally impaired patients treated with famotidine tablets for pathological hypersecretory conditions is unknown. e Recommended dosage regimen is 10 mg every other day. Since 20 mg or 40 mg tablet strength cannot be used for this dosage regimen, use an alternate famotidine formulation. 2.3 Administration Instructions \u2022 Take famotidine tablets once daily before bedtime or twice daily in the morning and before bedtime, as recommended. \u2022 Famotidine tablets may be taken with or without food [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. \u2022 Famotidine tablets may be given with antacids."
