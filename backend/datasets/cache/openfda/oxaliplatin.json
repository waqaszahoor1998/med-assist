    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Drugs that Prolong the QT Interval QT interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias can occur with oxaliplatin [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] . Avoid coadministration of oxaliplatin with medicinal products with a known potential to prolong the QT interval. 7.2 Use with Nephrotoxic Products Because platinum-containing species are eliminated primarily through the kidney, clearance of these products may be decreased by coadministration of potentially nephrotoxic compounds [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Avoid coadministration of oxaliplatin with medicinal products known to cause nephrotoxicity. 7.3 Use with Anticoagulants Prolonged prothrombin time and INR occasionally associated with hemorrhage have been reported in patients who received oxaliplatin with fluorouracil/leucovorin while on anticoagulants [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6.2 )] . Increase frequency of monitoring in patients who are receiving oxaliplatin with fluorouracil/leucovorin and oral anticoagulants."

    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in labeling: Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Peripheral Sensory Neuropathy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Severe Myelosuppression [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Pulmonary Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] QT Interval Prolongation and Ventricular Arrhythmias [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] Rhabdomyolysis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] Most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 40%) were peripheral sensory neuropathy, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, increase in transaminases and alkaline phosphatase, diarrhea, emesis, fatigue, and stomatitis. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Meitheal Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-844-824-8426 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. More than 1100 patients with stage II or III colon cancer and more than 4,000 patients with advanced colorectal cancer were treated in trials with oxaliplatin. The most common adverse reactions in patients with stage II or III colon cancer receiving adjuvant treatment were peripheral sensory neuropathy, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, increase in transaminases and alkaline phosphatase, diarrhea, emesis, fatigue and stomatitis. The most common adverse reactions in previously untreated and treated patients with advanced colorectal cancer were peripheral sensory neuropathies, fatigue, neutropenia, nausea, emesis, and diarrhea. Adjuvant Treatment The safety of oxaliplatin in combination with fluorouracil (FU)/leucovorin (LV) was evaluated in patients with stage II or III colon cancer, who had undergone complete resection of the primary tumor in the adjuvant treatment trial [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )]. Fatal adverse reactions in patients who received oxaliplatin in the combination arm included sepsis/neutropenic sepsis (n=3), intracerebral hemorrhage (n=2), and eosinophilic pneumonia (n=1). Thromboembolic events occurred in 6% (grade 3 to 4, 1.2%) of patients in the oxaliplatin arm. Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions occurred in 70% of patients in the oxaliplatin arm. Grade 3 to 4 gastrointestinal bleeding occurred in 0.2% of patients. Febrile neutropenia occurred in 0.7% and documented infection with concomitant grade 3 to 4 neutropenia occurred in 1.1%. Discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 15% of the patients in the oxaliplatin arm. Tables 5 , 6 , and 7 summarize the adverse reactions reported in patients with colon cancer receiving adjuvant treatment.

In patients greater than or equal to 65 years old, the incidence of grade 3 to 4 diarrhea and neutropenia was higher than in younger adults. Clinically relevant adverse reactions were reported in greater than or equal to 2% and less than 5% of the patients in the oxaliplatin arm (listed in decreasing order of frequency) were pain, leukopenia, weight loss, and cough.

The adverse reaction profile in this trial was similar to that seen in other trials. Three patients who received oxaliplatin in the combination arm experienced fatal adverse reactions: gastrointestinal bleeding and dehydration. Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia were reported in 27% and 17% of patients, respectively, in the oxaliplatin with fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm. Grade 3 to 4 increased serum creatinine occurred in 1% of patients in the oxaliplatin with combination fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. Thirteen percent of patients in the oxaliplatin with fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm discontinued treatment; the most frequent reasons were gastrointestinal adverse reactions, hematologic adverse reactions and neuropathies. Tables 11 , 12 , and 13 summarize the adverse reactions reported in the previously treated advanced colorectal cancer trial.

Intravenous site reactions Injection site reaction, including redness, swelling, and pain, can occur with oxaliplatin. In some cases, skin necrosis has occurred with extravasation. PRES PRES occurred in less than 0.1% of patients. Pulmonary fibrosis and interstitial lung disease Pulmonary fibrosis, which may be fatal, occurred in less than 1% of patients. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of oxaliplatin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. General: angioedema, anaphylactic shock Cardiovascular: QT prolongation leading to ventricular arrhythmias, including fatal torsade de pointes; bradyarrhythmia Neurological: loss of deep tendon reflexes, dysarthria, Lhermitte's sign, cranial nerve palsies, fasciculations, convulsion Hearing and vestibular system: deafness Infections: septic shock, including fatal outcomes Infusion-related reactions and hypersensitivity reactions: laryngospasm Hepatic and gastrointestinal: severe diarrhea/vomiting resulting in hypokalemia, colitis (including Clostridium difficile diarrhea), metabolic acidosis, ileus, intestinal obstruction, pancreatitis, sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, perisinusoidal fibrosis which rarely may progress, focal nodular hyperplasia, esophagitis Musculoskeletal and connective tissue: rhabdomyolysis, including fatal outcomes Platelet, bleeding, and clotting disorders: immuno-allergic thrombocytopenia, prolonged prothrombin time and INR in patients receiving anticoagulants Blood disorders: secondary leukemia Red blood cell: hemolytic uremic syndrome, immuno-allergic hemolytic anemia Renal: acute tubular necrosis, acute interstitial nephritis, acute renal failure Respiratory: interstitial lung diseases (sometimes fatal) and pneumonia (including fatal outcomes) Vision: decrease of visual acuity, visual field disturbance, optic neuritis and transient vision loss (reversible following treatment discontinuation) Injury, poisoning, and procedural complications: fall-related injuries"

Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures. 1 Do not freeze. Protect the concentrated solution from light. Dilute concentrated solution with 250 to 500 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP. Do not dilute with sodium chloride solution or other chloride-containing solutions. Store diluted solution for no more than 6 hours at room temperature (20\u00b0 to 25\u00b0C [68\u00b0 to 77\u00b0F]) or 24 hours under refrigeration (2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C [36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F]). Protection from light is not required. Visually inspect for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration and discard if present. Do not mix oxaliplatin injection or administer oxaliplatin injection through the same infusion line concurrently with alkaline medications or media (such as basic solutions of fluorouracil). Flush the infusion line with 5% Dextrose Injection, USP prior to administration of any concomitant medication. Do not use needles or intravenous administration sets containing aluminum parts for the preparation or mixing of oxaliplatin injection. Aluminum has been reported to cause degradation of platinum compounds. Administer oxaliplatin injection as an intravenous infusion over 120 minutes concurrently with leucovorin over 120 minutes in separate bags."
