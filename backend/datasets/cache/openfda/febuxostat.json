    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant administration of febuxostat with XO substrate drugs, azathioprine or mercaptopurine could increase plasma concentrations of these drugs resulting in severe toxicity. ( 7 ) 7.1 Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. Based on a drug interaction study in healthy patients, febuxostat altered the metabolism of theophylline (a substrate of XO) in humans [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Therefore, use with caution when coadministering febuxostat with theophylline. A drug interaction study of febuxostat and azathioprine, also metabolized by XO, showed an increase in exposure of 6-mercaptopurine which may lead to toxicity [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine) have not been conducted. Febuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [see Contraindications (4) ]. 7.2 Cytotoxic Chemotherapy Drugs Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with cytotoxic chemotherapy have not been conducted. No data are available regarding the safety of febuxostat during cytotoxic chemotherapy. 7.3 In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies Based on drug interaction studies in healthy patients, febuxostat does not have clinically significant interactions with colchicine, naproxen, indomethacin, hydrochlorothiazide, warfarin or desipramine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Therefore, febuxostat may be used concomitantly with these medications."

    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the prescribing information: Cardiovascular Death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Hepatic Effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Serious Skin Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Adverse reactions in \u2265 1% of patients treated with febuxostat are liver function abnormalities, nausea, arthralgia, and rash. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc. at 1-866-850-2876 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies, a total of 2757 patients with hyperuricemia and gout were treated with febuxostat 40 mg or 80 mg daily. For febuxostat 40 mg, 559 patients were treated for \u22656 months. For febuxostat 80 mg, 1377 patients were treated for \u22656 months, 674 patients were treated for \u22651 year and 515 patients were treated for \u22652 years. In the CARES study, a total of 3098 patients were treated with febuxostat 40 mg or 80 mg daily; of these, 2155 patients were treated for \u22651 year and 1539 were treated for \u22652 years [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Most Common Adverse Reactions In three randomized, controlled clinical studies (Studies 1, 2 and 3), which were 6 to 12 months in duration, the following adverse reactions were reported by the treating physician as related to study drug. Table 1 summarizes adverse reactions reported at a rate of at least 1% in febuxostat treatment groups and at least 0.5% greater than placebo. * Of the patients who received allopurinol, 10 received 100 mg, 145 received 200 mg, and 1122 received 300 mg, based on level of renal impairment. Table 1: Adverse Reactions Occurring in \u22651% of Patients Treated with Febuxostat and at Least 0.5% Greater than in Patients Receiving Placebo in Controlled Studies Adverse Reactions Placebo Febuxostat allopurinol* (N=134) 40 mg daily (N=757) 80 mg daily (N=1279) (N=1277) Liver Function Abnormalities 0.7% 6.6% 4.6% 4.2% Nausea 0.7% 1.1% 1.3% 0.8% Arthralgia 0% 1.1% 0.7% 0.7% Rash 0.7% 0.5% 1.6% 1.6% The most common adverse reaction leading to discontinuation from therapy was liver function abnormalities in 1.8% of febuxostat 40 mg, 1.2% of febuxostat 80 mg, and in 0.9% of patients treated with allopurinol. In addition to the adverse reactions presented in Table 1, dizziness was reported in more than 1% of patients treated with febuxostat although not at a rate more than 0.5% greater than placebo. In the CARES study, liver function abnormalities and diarrhea were reported in more than 1% of patients treated with febuxostat, although not at a rate more than 0.5% greater than allopurinol.
