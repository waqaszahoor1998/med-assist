    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See Full Prescribing Information for a list of clinically significant drug interactions. ( 7.1 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on CERDELGA Coadministration of CERDELGA with: CYP2D6 or CYP3A inhibitors may increase eliglustat concentrations which may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias from prolongation of the PR, QTc, and/or QRS cardiac interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . strong CYP3A inducers decrease eliglustat concentrations which may reduce CERDELGA efficacy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . See Table 5 for prevention and management of interactions with drugs affecting CERDELGA. Use of CERDELGA is contraindicated, to be avoided, or may require dosage adjustment depending on the concomitant drug and CYP2D6 metabolizer status [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.3) , Contraindications (4) , Drug Interactions (7.1) ] .

Table 6: Prevention and Management Strategies of Drug Interactions Affecting Other Drugs Substrates for P-gp or CYP2D6 Clinical Impact Coadministration of CERDELGA may increase concentrations of drugs that are substrates for P-gp or CYP2D6 [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] and may increase the risk of toxicity of these drugs. Prevention or Management Digoxin Monitor serum digoxin concentrations before initiating CERDELGA. Reduce digoxin dose by 30% and continue monitoring. Other P-gp substrates or CYP2D6 substrates Monitor therapeutic drug concentrations, as indicated, or consider reducing the dosage of the concomitant drug and titrate to clinical effect."

    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (\u226510%) are: fatigue, headache, nausea, diarrhea, back pain, pain in extremities, and upper abdominal pain. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Genzyme Corporation at 1-800-745-4447 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common adverse reactions to CERDELGA (occurring in \u226510% of the 126 GD1 patients treated with CERDELGA across Trials 1 and 2) were fatigue, headache, nausea, diarrhea, back pain, pain in extremities, and upper abdominal pain. The adverse reaction profile of CERDELGA is based on two controlled studies, Trials 1 and 2 [see Clinical Studies (14.1 , 14.2) ] . Table 3 presents the profile from the 9-month double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of 40 treatment-naive patients (Trial 1). Patients were between the ages of 16 and 63 on the date of the first dose of study drug, and included 20 males and 20 females.

Patients were between the ages of 18 and 69 on the date of the first dose of CERDELGA, and included 87 females and 72 males. Table 4: Adverse Reactions Occurring in \u22655% of GD1 Patients Switching from Enzyme Replacement Therapy to CERDELGA and More Frequently than Imiglucerase (Trial 2) Trial 2 was not designed to support comparative claims for CERDELGA for the adverse reactions reported in this table.
