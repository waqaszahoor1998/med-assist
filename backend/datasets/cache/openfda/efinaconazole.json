(6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Bausch Health US, LLC at 1-800-321-4576 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In two clinical trials, 1227 subjects were treated with JUBLIA, 1161 for at least 24 weeks and 780 for 48 weeks. Adverse reactions reported within 48 weeks of treatment and in at least 1% of subjects treated with JUBLIA and those reported in subjects treated with the vehicle are presented in Table 1 .

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
