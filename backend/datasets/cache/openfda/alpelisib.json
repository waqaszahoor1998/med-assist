    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS CYP3A4 Inducers : Avoid coadministration of VIJOICE with a strong CYP3A4 inducer. Consider an alternative concomitant drug with no or minimal potential to induce CYP3A4. ( 7.1 ) Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) Inhibitors : Avoid the use of BCRP inhibitors in patients treated with VIJOICE. If unable to use alternative drugs, closely monitor for increased adverse reactions. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on VIJOICE CYP3A4 Inducers Avoid coadministration of VIJOICE with strong CYP3A4 inducers and consider an alternative concomitant drug with no or minimal potential to induce CYP3A4. Alpelisib is metabolized by CYP3A4. Concomitant use of VIJOICE with a strong CYP3A4 inducer may decrease alpelisib concentration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] , which may decrease alpelisib activity. Breast Cancer Resistance Protein Inhibitors (BCRP) Avoid the use of BCRP inhibitors in patients treated with VIJOICE. If unable to use alternative drugs, when VIJOICE is used in combination with BCRP inhibitors, closely monitor for increased adverse reactions. Alpelisib is transported by BCRP. Concomitant use of VIJOICE with a BCRP inhibitor may increase alpelisib exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] , which may increase the risk of adverse reactions."

    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Severe Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Hyperglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Pneumonitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Diarrhea or Colitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Most common adverse reactions (Grades 1 to 4, incidence \u2265 10%) were diarrhea, stomatitis, and hyperglycemia. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation at 1-888-669-6682 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of VIJOICE was evaluated in EPIK-P1 (NCT04285723), a single-arm clinical study in patients who were treated as part of an expanded access program for compassionate use. Fifty-seven patients 2 years of age and older with severe or life-threatening PIK3CA-Related Overgrowth Spectrum (PROS) received VIJOICE based on age at dosages ranging from 50 mg to 250 mg orally once daily [see Clinical Studies (14)] . Among patients who received VIJOICE, 95% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 79% were exposed for greater than one year. The median age of patients who received VIJOICE was 14 years (range, 2 to 50); 58% were female; 12% were White and race was not reported for 88%. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 12% of patients who received VIJOICE. Serious adverse reactions occurring in two or more patients included dehydration (n = 2) and cellulitis (n = 2). Dosage interruption of VIJOICE due to an adverse reaction occurred in 11% of patients. Adverse reactions which required dosage interruption in two or more patients included dizziness (n = 2) and vomiting (n = 2). Dose reductions of VIJOICE due to an adverse reaction occurred in 5% of patients. Adverse reactions which required dose reduction included alopecia, memory impairment, and soft tissue infection. The most common adverse reactions (\u2265 10%) were diarrhea, stomatitis, and hyperglycemia. The most common Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities (\u2265 2%) were increased glucose, decreased hemoglobin, decreased phosphate, increased bilirubin, decreased sodium, and decreased platelets. Adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities are listed in Table 10 and Table 11, respectively.

Patient age (years) Initial dose Dose increase 2 to < 6 50 mg a Not applicable b 6 to < 18 50 mg a 125 mg 2.2 VIJOICE Dosage Form Overview VIJOICE is available in two dosage forms: tablets and oral granules. Prescribe the most appropriate dosage form of VIJOICE according to the dose required and patient needs. VIJOICE Tablets (50 mg, 125 mg, and 200 mg) may be administered as: Whole tablets: For patients who can swallow whole tablets. Tablets prepared as an oral suspension: For patients who have difficulty swallowing whole tablets [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] . VIJOICE Oral Granules (50 mg per packet): For patients who are prescribed a 50 mg daily dose only [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] . Do not use multiple 50 mg packets or a partial packet of oral granules for patients prescribed a 125 mg or a 250 mg dose [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Do not combine VIJOICE tablets and VIJOICE oral granules to achieve the prescribed dose. 2.3 VIJOICE Administration Overview Take VIJOICE with food at approximately the same time each day [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . If a dose of VIJOICE is missed, it can be taken with food within 9 hours after the time it is usually taken. After more than 9 hours, skip the dose for that day. The next day, take VIJOICE at the usual time. If the patient vomits after taking the dose, advise the patient not to take an additional dose on that day, and to resume the dosing schedule the next day at the usual time. 2.4 VIJOICE Preparation and Administration Instructions VIJOICE Tablets Swallow VIJOICE tablets whole, or prepare as a suspension to administer orally, or via feeding tubes. VIJOICE Tablets, Whole Swallow VIJOICE tablets whole and take with food. Do not chew, divide, or crush. Do not use broken, cracked, or damaged tablets. VIJOICE Tablets Prepared as a Suspension for Oral use, or Feeding Tubes (Nasogastric or Gastric Tube) Administration For patients who are not able to swallow tablets, or who are using a feeding tube, prepare and administer VIJOICE as a suspension and take with food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . To prepare VIJOICE tablets as a suspension for oral use, place VIJOICE tablets in a cup containing 2 to 4 ounces of water. To prepare VIJOICE tablets as a suspension for feeding tubes administration, place VIJOICE tablets in a cup containing 1 to 2 ounces of water. Make the suspension with water only. Let tablets stand in water for approximately 5 minutes. Crush the tablets with a spoon and stir until a suspension is obtained. Immediately after preparation, administer the suspension as directed below. If not administered immediately after preparation, stir the suspension with the same spoon to re-suspend any particles before administration. Discard the suspension if it is not administered within 60 minutes after preparation. Oral Administration Administer the suspension from the cup. After administration of the suspension, add approximately 1 to 2 ounces of water to the same cup. Stir with the same spoon to re-suspend any remaining particles and administer the entire contents of the cup orally. Repeat if particles remain. Feeding Tubes Administration Administer VIJOICE tablets prepared as a suspension via French size 5 to 12 diameter silicone or polyurethane nasogastric tubes, or via French size 12 to 24 diameter silicone gastric tubes. Withdraw VIJOICE suspension from the cup into an enteral syringe and administer it via the nasogastric or gastric tube. After administration, add approximately 1 to 2 ounces (approximately 30 to 60 mL) of water to the same cup. Stir with the same spoon to re-suspend any remaining particles. Withdraw the contents of the cup into the same enteral syringe and administer it via the nasogastric or gastric tube. Repeat if particles remain. VIJOICE Oral Granules Administer VIJOICE oral granules directly onto the tongue with water, or prepare as a suspension or a mixture for oral use. To administer via feeding tubes prepare the suspension with water only. Each packet is for single use only. No packet should be used if the packet seal is broken. Do not attempt to use partial quantities of oral granules from 50 mg granules packets to prepare a dose. Do not combine VIJOICE tablets and VIJOICE oral granules to achieve the prescribed dose of 125 mg or 250 mg. For patients for whom a daily dose of 50 mg is prescribed, administer VIJOICE oral granules [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] in one of the following ways: VIJOICE Oral Granules for Direct Oral Administration Pour the contents of one VIJOICE oral granules packet directly onto the tongue and swallow with approximately 2 to 4 ounces of water. If needed, rinse the mouth with additional water and swallow to ensure no particles remain in the mouth. VIJOICE Oral Granules as a Suspension or a Mixture for Oral administration Pour the contents of one VIJOICE oral granules packet into a cup. Add 1 to 3 teaspoons (about 0.5 ounces) of a beverage (water, milk, or apple juice) or soft food (applesauce or yogurt) and stir with a spoon, then administer the suspension or the mixture immediately. Rinse the cup with up to 2 ounces of a beverage (water, milk or apple juice) and administer the rinse immediately to ensure the entire dose is administered. If particles remain, repeat until the full dose is administered. If not administered immediately after preparation, stir the suspension or the mixture with the same spoon to re-suspend any particles before administration. Discard the oral granules mixed with water, milk, apple juice, applesauce, or yogurt if they are not administered within 60 minutes after preparation. VIJOICE Oral Granules Suspension for Feeding Tubes Administration For patients who are not able to swallow VIJOICE orally, administer VIJOICE via feeding tubes. Administer VIJOICE granules via French size 8 to 12 diameter silicone or polyurethane nasogastric tubes or via French size 12 to 24 diameter silicone gastric tubes. Pour the contents of one VIJOICE granules packet into a cup. Add 4 teaspoons (about 0.7 ounces or 20 mL) of water and stir gently with a spoon until a suspension is obtained. Make the suspension with water only. Immediately after preparation, withdraw the suspension from the cup into an enteral syringe and administer it via the nasogastric or gastric tube. After administration, add 4 teaspoons (about 0.7 ounces or 20 mL) of water to the same cup. Stir with the same spoon to re-suspend any remaining particles. Withdraw the contents of the cup into the same enteral syringe and administer it via the nasogastric or gastric tube. Repeat if particles remain. If not administered immediately after preparation, stir the suspension with the same spoon to re-suspend any particles before withdrawing into an enteral syringe for administration. Discard the suspension if it is not administered within 60 minutes after preparation. 2.5 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions The recommended VIJOICE dose reductions for adverse reactions in adult and pediatric patients are listed in Table 2 and Table 3, respectively.

Tables 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 summarize recommendations for dose interruption, reduction, or discontinuation of VIJOICE in the management of specific adverse reactions. Cutaneous Adverse Reactions If a severe cutaneous adverse reaction (SCAR) is confirmed, permanently discontinue VIJOICE. Do not reintroduce VIJOICE in patients who have experienced previous SCAR during VIJOICE treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . Table 4: Dosage Modification and Management for Rash and Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions (SCARs) a Grading according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0. b For all grades of rash, consider consultation with a dermatologist. c Antihistamines administered prior to rash onset may decrease incidence and severity of rash. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)] Grade a,b Recommendation for adult and pediatric patients c Grade 1 (< 10% body surface area [BSA] with active skin toxicity) No VIJOICE dosage modification is required unless the etiology is determined to be SCAR. Initiate topical corticosteroid treatment. Consider adding oral antihistamine to manage symptoms. If active rash is not improved within 28 days of appropriate treatment, add a low dose systemic corticosteroid. If the etiology is determined to be SCAR, permanently discontinue VIJOICE. Grade 2 (10% to 30% BSA with active skin toxicity) No VIJOICE dosage modification is required unless the etiology is determined to be SCAR. Initiate or intensify topical corticosteroid and oral antihistamine treatment. Consider low dose systemic corticosteroid treatment. If rash improves to Grade \u2264 1 within 10 days, systemic corticosteroid may be discontinued. If the etiology is determined to be SCAR, permanently discontinue VIJOICE. Grade 3 (e.g., severe rash not responsive to medical management) (> 30% BSA with active skin toxicity) Interrupt VIJOICE and initiate or intensify topical/systemic corticosteroid and oral antihistamine treatment. If the etiology is determined to be SCAR, permanently discontinue VIJOICE. For rashes other than SCAR Adult Patients: Upon improvement to Grade \u2264 1, resume VIJOICE at the next lower dose level. Pediatric Patients: Upon improvement to Grade \u2264 1, either resume VIJOICE at 50 mg while continuing oral antihistamine treatment or permanently discontinue VIJOICE. Permanently discontinue VIJOICE if: Patient was receiving antihistamines at the time of rash onset and antihistamine dose cannot be increased Grade \u2265 3 rash recurs Grade 4 (e.g., severe bullous, blistering or exfoliating skin conditions) (any % BSA associated with extensive superinfection, with IV antibiotics indicated; life-threatening consequences) Permanently discontinue VIJOICE. Hyperglycemia Before initiating treatment with VIJOICE, test fasting plasma glucose (FPG), HbA1c, and optimize blood glucose. After initiating treatment with VIJOICE, monitor fasting glucose (FPG or fasting blood glucose) at least once every week for the first 2 weeks, then at least once every 4 weeks, and as clinically indicated. Monitor HbA1c every 3 months and as clinically indicated. In patients with risk factors for hyperglycemia, monitor fasting glucose more closely and as clinically indicated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] .
