    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling: \u2022 Ophthalmic Adverse Reaction [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] \u2022 Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] The most common adverse reactions (\u22652 %) are local skin reactions, application site pain, application site pruritus, application site irritation, application site infection, periorbital edema, nasopharyngitis and headache. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Perrigo at 1-866-634-9120 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. The data described below reflect exposure to ingenol mebutate gel in 499 subjects with actinic keratosis, including 274 subjects exposed to ingenol mebutate gel field treatment (skin area of 25 cm 2 in the face or scalp regions) at a concentration of 0.015% once daily for 3 consecutive days, and 225 subjects exposed to ingenol mebutate gel field treatment (skin area of 25 cm 2 in the trunk or extremities regions) at a concentration of 0.05% once daily for 2 consecutive days. Local skin reactions, including erythema, flaking/scaling, crusting, swelling, vesiculation/pustulation, and erosion/ulceration were assessed within the selected treatment area and graded by the investigator on a scale of 0 to 4. A grade of 0 represented no reaction present in the treated area, and a grade of 4 indicated a marked and severe skin reaction that extended beyond the treated area. Table 1. Investigator Assessment of Maximal Local Skin Reactions in the Treatment Area during the 57 Days Post Treatment Period (face/scalp trials) Face and Scalp (N=545) Ingenol Mebutate Gel, 0.015% once daily for 3 days Skin reactions Any Grade a > Baseline Grade 4 Ingenol Mebutate Gel (N=274) Vehicle (N=271) Ingenol Mebutate Gel (N=274) Vehicle (N=271) Erythema 258 (94%) 69 (25%) 66 (24%) 0 (0%) Flaking/Scaling 233 (85%) 67 (25%) 25 (9%) 0 (0%) Crusting 220 (80%) 46 (17%) 16 (6%) 0 (0%) Swelling 217 (79%) 11 (4%) 14 (5%) 0 (0%) Vesiculation/Pustulation 154 (56%) 1 (0%) 15 (5%) 0 (0%) Erosion/Ulceration 87 (32%) 3 (1%) 1 (0%) 0 (0%) a Mild (grade 1), Moderate (grade 2-3) or Severe (grade 4). Table 2.

Local skin reactions typically occurred within 1 day of treatment initiation, peaked in intensity up to 1 week following completion of treatment, and resolved within 2 weeks for areas treated on the face and scalp, and within 4 weeks for areas treated on the trunk and extremities. Adverse reactions that occurred in \u22652% of subjects treated with ingenol mebutate gel and at a higher frequency than the vehicle are presented in Table 3 and Table 4. Table 3.

Adverse reactions occurring in \u2265 2% of subjects treated with ingenol mebutate gel and at higher frequency than vehicle (trunk/extremities trials) Trunk/Extremities Adverse Reactions Ingenol Mebutate Gel, 0.05% (N=225) Vehicle (N=232) Application Site Pruritus 18 (8%) 0 (0%) Application Site Irritation 8 (4%) 1 (0%) Nasopharyngitis 4 (2%) 2 (1%) Application Site Pain 5 (2%) 0 (0%) Less common adverse reactions in subjects treated with ingenol mebutate gel included: eyelid edema, eye pain, conjunctivitis. A total of 108 subjects treated with ingenol mebutate gel on the face/scalp and 38 subjects treated on the trunk/extremities were followed for 12 months. Results from these studies did not change the safety profile of ingenol mebutate gel. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ingenol mebutate gel, 0.015% and 0.05%. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Eye disorders: chemical conjunctivitis, corneal burn Immune system disorders: hypersensitivity, Stevens-Johnson syndrome Infections: herpes zoster Skin and Subcutaneous disorders: non-melanoma skin cancer, allergic contact dermatitis, application site pigmentation changes, application site scarring"
