    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Local Skin Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Most common (incidence \u22651%) adverse reactions are the following local skin reactions at the application site: vesiculation, pain, pruritus, scabbing, erythema, discoloration, application site dryness, edema, and erosion. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Verrica Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-877-837-7422 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. Local skin reactions are expected and should be reported if they are severe. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. YCANTH was studied in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trials, Trial 1 (NCT03377790) and Trial 2 (NCT03377803) (n = 266, and n = 262, respectively) in subjects with molluscum contagiosum. Most patients received a single 24-hour dermal administration of YCANTH or vehicle for each lesion every 3 weeks for up to 4 treatments. YCANTH Solution or vehicle were removed prior to the 24-hour timepoint in 109/311 (35%) subjects treated with YCANTH Solution and 46/216 (21%) subjects treated with vehicle due to treatment-emergent adverse events. Table 1 presents the percentage of subjects with selected adverse reactions (incidence \u2265 1%) by the most severe grade reported during Trial 1 and Trial 2. Adverse reactions were primarily local skin reactions at the application site. Local skin reactions at the application site were observed in 97% of subjects treated with YCANTH during both trials.
