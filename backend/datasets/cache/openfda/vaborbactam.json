    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Hormonal Contraceptives: Effectiveness may be reduced; use an effective alternative non-hormonal form of contraception or additional contraceptive method. ( 7.4 , 12.3 ) 7.1 Valproic Acid Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including meropenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction in valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Although the mechanism of this interaction is unknown, data from in vitro and animal studies suggest that carbapenems may inhibit the hydrolysis of valproic acid's glucuronide metabolite (VPA-g) back to valproic acid, thus decreasing the serum concentrations of valproic acid. If administration of VABOMERE is necessary, then supplemental anti-convulsant therapy should be considered [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . 7.2 Probenecid Probenecid competes with meropenem for active tubular secretion, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of meropenem. Co-administration of probenecid with VABOMERE is not recommended [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.3 Potential for VABOMERE to Affect Other Drugs When administering VABOMERE concomitantly with medicinal products that are predominantly metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP2C, and/or are substrates of P-gp transporters, there is a potential risk of interaction which may result in decreased plasma concentrations and activity of the co-administered drug(s) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. When VABOMERE is concomitantly administered with the substrates of CYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP2C, and/or P-gp, refer to the prescribing information for these concomitant medications for guidance on need for dosage adjustments and/or need for frequent drug level monitoring when administered with a weak CYP inducer(s). When administering VABOMERE concomitantly with medicinal products that are substrate of OAT3 transporters, there is a potential risk of interaction which may result in increased plasma concentrations and activity of the co-administered drug(s) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. When VABOMERE is concomitantly administered with OAT3 substrate(s), refer to the prescribing information for these concomitant medication(s) for guidance on need for dosage adjustments and/or need for frequent drug level monitoring when administered with an OAT3 inhibitor(s). 7.4 Hormonal Contraceptives Hormonal contraceptives (e.g., combined oral contraceptives containing a progestin and an estrogen) are metabolized by CYP3A and other pregnane X receptor (PXR)-regulated enzymes. Therefore, the blood concentration and the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives may be reduced when used with VABOMERE [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Effective alternative non-hormonal forms of contraception or additional contraceptive methods are recommended for patients taking hormonal contraceptives when treated concomitantly with VABOMERE [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in the Warnings and Precautions section: Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Seizure Potential [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Rhabdomyolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Clostridioides difficile -associated Diarrhea [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Risk of Breakthrough Seizures Due to Drug Interaction with Valproic Acid [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Thrombocytopenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Potential for Neuromotor Impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Overgrowth of Non-susceptible Organisms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] The most frequently reported adverse reactions occurring in \u22653% of patients treated with VABOMERE were headache, phlebitis/infusion site reactions, and diarrhea. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Melinta Therapeutics at 1-844-633-6568 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. VABOMERE was evaluated in a Phase 3 comparator-controlled clinical trial in cUTI, including pyelonephritis, which included 272 patients treated with VABOMERE and 273 patients treated with the comparator piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5 grams (piperacillin 4 g/tazobactam 0.5 g) every 8 hours. After a minimum of 15 doses of IV therapy, patients could be switched to oral levofloxacin (500 mg daily every 24 hours) to complete the treatment course. Mean duration of IV therapy was 8 days in both treatment groups. Mean duration of IV and oral therapy was 10 days; patients with baseline bacteremia could receive up to 14 days of treatment. The mean age of patients treated with VABOMERE was 53 years (range 18 to 92 years), and 32% of patients were 65 years of age or older. Patients were predominantly female (66.5%) and White (93.4%). Most patients were enrolled in Europe (89.7%). Serious Adverse Reactions and Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation Treatment was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 2.9% (8/272) of patients receiving VABOMERE and in 5.1% (14/273) of patients receiving piperacillin/tazobactam. Most common adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of VABOMERE included hypersensitivity, 1.1% (3/272) and infusion-related reactions, 0.7% (2/272). Death occurred in 2 (0.7%) patients who received VABOMERE and in 2 (0.7%) patients who received piperacillin/tazobactam. Common Adverse Reactions The most frequently reported adverse reactions (3% or greater) in patients receiving VABOMERE in the Phase 3 cUTI trial were headache, phlebitis/infusion site reactions, and diarrhea. Table 3 provides adverse reactions occurring in 1% or greater of patients receiving VABOMERE in the Phase 3 cUTI trial.

  "indications": [
    "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE VABOMERE (meropenem and vaborbactam) is a combination of meropenem, a penem antibacterial, and vaborbactam, a beta-lactamase inhibitor, indicated for the treatment of patients 18 years and older with complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) including pyelonephritis caused by designated susceptible bacteria. ( 1.1 ) To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of VABOMERE and other antibacterial drugs, VABOMERE should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. ( 1.2 ) 1.1. Complicated Urinary Tract Infections (cUTI), including Pyelonephritis VABOMERE \u00ae is indicated for the treatment of patients 18 years of age and older with complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) including pyelonephritis caused by the following susceptible microorganisms: Escherichia coli , Klebsiella pneumoniae , and Enterobacter cloacae species complex. 1.2. Usage To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of VABOMERE and other antibacterial drugs, VABOMERE should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."
