    "WARNINGS Amplification of the vasodilatory effects of isosorbide mononitrate by sildenafil can result in severe hypotension. The time course and dose dependence of this interaction have not been studied. Appropriate supportive care has not been studied, but it seems reasonable to treat this as a nitrate overdose, with elevation of the extremities and with central volume expansion. The benefits of ISMN in patients with acute myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure have not been established; because the effects of isosorbide mononitrate are difficult to terminate rapidly, this drug is not recommended in these settings. If isosorbide mononitrate is used in these conditions, careful clinical or hemodynamic monitoring must be used to avoid the hazards of hypotension and tachycardia."

    "ADVERSE REACTIONS The table below shows the frequencies of the adverse events that occurred in >5% of the subjects in three placebo-controlled North American studies, in which patients in the active treatment arm received 30 mg, 60 mg, 120 mg, or 240 mg of isosorbide mononitrate extended-release tablets once daily. In parentheses, the same table shows the frequencies with which these adverse events were associated with the discontinuation of treatment. Overall, 8% of the patients who received 30 mg, 60 mg, 120 mg, or 240 mg of isosorbide mononitrate in the three placebo-controlled North American studies discontinued treatment because of adverse events. Most of these discontinued because of headache. Dizziness was rarely associated with withdrawal from these studies. Since headache appears to be a dose-related adverse effect and tends to disappear with continued treatment, it is recommended that ISMN treatment be initiated at low doses for several days before being increased to desired levels. FREQUENCY AND ADVERSE EVENTS (DISCONTINUED) * * Some individuals discontinued for multiple reasons. * * Patients were started on 60 mg and titrated to their final dose. Three Controlled North American Studies Dose Placebo 30mg 60mg 120mg * * 240mg * * Patients 96 60 102 65 65 Headache 15%(0%) 38%(5%) 51%(8%) 42%(5%) 57%(8%) Dizziness 4%(0%) 8%(0%) 11%(1%) 9%(2%) 9%(2%) In addition, the three North American trials were pooled with 11 controlled trials conducted in Europe. Among the 14 controlled trials, a total of 711 patients were randomized to isosorbide mononitrate extended-release tablets. When the pooled data were reviewed, headache and dizziness were the only adverse events that were reported by >5% of patients.
