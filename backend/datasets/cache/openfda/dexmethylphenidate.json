    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Antihypertensive Drugs: Monitor blood pressure. Adjust dosage of antihypertensive drug as needed. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Clinically Important Interactions with AZSTARYS Table 1 presents clinically important drug interactions with AZSTARYS. Table 1: Clinically Important Drug Interactions with AZSTARYS Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) Clinical Impact Concomitant use of MAOIs and CNS stimulants, including AZSTARYS, can cause hypertensive crisis. Potential outcomes include death, stroke, myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, ophthalmological complications, eclampsia, pulmonary edema, and renal failure [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . Intervention Do not administer AZSTARYS concomitantly with MAOIs or within 14 days after discontinuing MAOI treatment [see Contraindications ( 4 )] Antihypertensive Drugs Clinical Impact AZSTARYS may decrease the effectiveness of drugs used to treat hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . Intervention Monitor blood pressure and adjust the dosage of the antihypertensive drug, as needed. Halogenated Anesthetics Clinical Impact Concomitant use of halogenated anesthetics and AZSTARYS may increase the risk of sudden blood pressure and heart rate increase during surgery. Intervention Avoid use of AZSTARYS in patients being treated with anesthetics on the day of surgery. Risperidone Clinical Impact Combined use of methylphenidate with risperidone when there is a change, whether an increase or decrease, in dosage of either or both medications, may increase the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). Intervention Monitor for signs of EPS."

    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling: Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , and Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2 , 9.3) ] Known hypersensitivity to methylphenidate or other ingredients of AZSTARYS [see Contraindications (4) ] Hypertensive Crisis with Concomitant Use of Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors [see Contraindications (4) ] Risks to Patients with Serious Cardiac Disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Increased Blood Pressure and Heart Rate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Psychiatric Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Priapism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Peripheral Vasculopathy, including Raynaud's Phenomenon [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Long-Term Suppression of Growth in Pediatric Patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Increased Intraocular Pressure and Glaucoma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Motor and Verbal Tics, and Worsening of Tourette\u2019s Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] Based on accumulated data from other methylphenidate products, the most common (>5% and twice the rate of placebo) adverse reactions are appetite decreased, insomnia, nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, weight decreased, anxiety, dizziness, irritability, affect lability, tachycardia, and blood pressure increased. ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Corium, Inc. at 1-800-910-8432 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Adverse Reactions in Studies with Other Methylphenidate Products in Pediatric Patients and Adults with ADHD Commonly reported (\u2265 5% of the methylphenidate group and at least twice the rate of the placebo group) adverse reactions from placebo-controlled trials of methylphenidate products include: decreased appetite, decreased weight, nausea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, vomiting, insomnia, anxiety, affect lability, irritability, dizziness, increased blood pressure, and tachycardia. Adverse Reactions in Studies with AZSTARYS in Pediatric Patients (6 to 12 years) with ADHD Short-Term Study A short-term study conducted in pediatric patients 6 to 12 years of age with ADHD was comprised of a 3-week, open-label, dose optimization phase in which all patients received AZSTARYS (n=155), followed by a 1-week, double-blind, controlled phase in which patients were randomized to continue AZSTARYS (n=74) or switch to placebo (n=76). Because of the study design, the reported adverse reaction rates cannot be used to predict the rates that may be expected in clinical practice. Long-Term Study A long-term, open-label safety study was conducted in pediatric patients 6 to 12 years of age with ADHD who either completed the short-term study or were de novo patients. This study was comprised of a 3-week dose optimization phase for patients not recently treated with AZSTARYS followed by a 12-month treatment phase for all patients during which 238 patients received open- label AZSTARYS and had evaluable safety data. A total of 154 patients were treated for 12 months. Because of the open-label, uncontrolled design of this study, the reported adverse reaction rates cannot be assessed in terms of a causal relationship to AZSTARYS treatment. To adjust for normal growth, z-scores were derived (measured in standard deviations [SD]); z- scores normalize for the natural growth of children and adolescents by comparisons to age- and sex-matched population standards. A z-score change less than 0.5 SD is considered not clinically significant. In this study, the mean increase in weight from baseline to Month 12 was 3.4 kg among study completers. The mean change in z-score from baseline to Month 12 was -0.20, indicating a lower than expected increase in body weight compared to children of the same age and sex, on average. Most of the weight z-score decline occurred in the first 4 months of treatment. The mean increase in height from baseline to Month 12 was 4.9 cm among completers. Using the same z-score analysis for height, the mean change in z-score from baseline to Month 12 was - 0.21, indicating a lower than expected increase in height compared to pediatric patients of the same age and sex, on average. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of methylphenidate products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These adverse reactions are as follows: Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders : pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia, thrombocytopenic purpura Cardiac Disorders : angina pectoris, bradycardia, extrasystole, supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular extrasystole, palpitations, increased heart rate Eye Disorders : diplopia, increased intraocular pressure, mydriasis, visual impairment, blurred vision General Disorders : chest pain, chest discomfort, hyperpyrexia Gastrointestinal Disorders : dry mouth Hepatobiliary disorders : hepatocellular injury, acute hepatic failure Immune System Disorders : hypersensitivity reactions such as angioedema, anaphylactic reactions, auricular swelling, bullous conditions, exfoliative conditions, urticarias, pruritus NEC, rashes, eruptions, and exanthemas NEC Investigations : alkaline phosphatase increased, bilirubin increased, hepatic enzyme increased, platelet count decreased, white blood cell count abnormal Musculoskeletal, Connective Tissue and Bone Disorders : arthralgia, myalgia, muscle twitching, rhabdomyolysis, muscle cramps Nervous System : convulsion, grand mal convulsion, dyskinesia, serotonin syndrome in combination with serotonergic drugs, nervousness, headache, tremor, drowsiness, vertigo, motor and verbal tics Psychiatric Disorders : disorientation, libido changes, hallucination, hallucination auditory, hallucination visual, logorrhea, mania, restlessness, agitation Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders : alopecia, erythema, hyperhidrosis Urogenital System : priapism Vascular Disorders : Raynaud's phenomenon"
