    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (incidence \u22655% more than placebo) include: Adult patients: somnolence, asthenia, infection and dizziness ( 6.1 ) Pediatric patients: fatigue, aggression, nasal congestion, decreased appetite, and irritability ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Lupin Pharmaceutical Inc. at 1-800-399-2561 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . The following adverse reactions are discussed in more details in other sections of labeling: Behavior Abnormalities and Psychotic Symptoms [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.1 )] Suicidal Behavior and Ideation [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.2 )] Somnolence and Fatigue [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.3 )] Anaphylaxis and Angioedema [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.4 )] Serious Dermatological Reactions [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.5 )] Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.6 )] Coordination Difficulties [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.7 )] Hematologic Abnormalities [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.9 )] Increase in Blood Pressure [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.10 )] 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Partial - Onset Seizures Adults: In controlled clinical studies in adults with partial - onset seizures-, [ see CLINICAL STUDIES ( 14.1 ) ], the most common adverse reactions in patients receiving levetiracetam in combination with other AEDs, for events with rates greater than placebo, were somnolence, asthenia, infection, and dizziness. Of the most common adverse reactions in adults experiencing partial - onset seizures, asthenia, somnolence, and dizziness occurred predominantly during the first 4 weeks of treatment with levetiracetam. Table 3 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 1% of adult epilepsy patients receiving levetiracetam in placebo-controlled studies and were numerically more common than in patients treated with placebo. In these studies, either levetiracetam or placebo was added to concurrent AED therapy. Levetiracetam (N = 769) % Placebo (N=439) % Asthenia 15 9 Somnolence 15 8 Headache 14 13 Infection 13 8 Dizziness 9 4 Pain 7 6 Pharyngitis 6 4 Depression 4 2 Nervousness 4 2 Rhinitis 4 3 Anorexia 3 2 Ataxia 3 1 Vertigo 3 1 Amnesia 2 1 Anxiety 2 1 Cough Increased 2 1 Diplopia 2 1 Emotional Lability 2 0 Hostility 2 1 Paresthesia 2 1 Sinusitis 2 1 In controlled adult clinical studies, 15% of patients receiving levetiracetam and 12% receiving placebo either discontinued or had a dose reduction as a result of an adverse reaction. Table 4 lists the most common (>1%) adverse reactions that resulted in discontinuation or dose reduction and that occurred more frequently in levetiracetam-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients. Adverse Reaction Levetiracetam (N=769) % Placebo (N=439) % Somnolence 4 2 Dizziness 1 0 Pediatric Patients 4 Years to <16 Years: The adverse reaction data presented below was obtained from a pooled analysis of two controlled pediatric clinical studies in pediatric patients 4 to 16 years of age with partial onset seizures. The most common adverse reactions in pediatric patients receiving levetiracetam in combination with other AEDs, for events with rates greater than placebo, were fatigue, aggression, nasal congestion, decreased appetite, and irritability. Table 5 lists adverse reactions from the pooled pediatric controlled studies (4 to 16 years of age) that occurred in at least 2% of pediatric levetiracetam-treated patients and were numerically more common than in pediatric patients treated with placebo. In these studies, either levetiracetam or placebo was added to concurrent AED therapy.

Pediatric Patients 1 Month to < 4 Years: In the 7-day, controlled pediatric clinical study in children 1 month to less than 4 years of age with partial - onset seizures, the most common adverse reactions in patients receiving levetiracetam in combination with other AEDs, for events with rates greater than placebo, were somnolence and irritability. Because of the shorter exposure period, incidences of adverse reactions are expected to be lower than in other pediatric studies in older patients. Therefore, other controlled pediatric data, presented above, should also be considered to apply to this age group. Table 6 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 5% of pediatric epilepsy patients (ages 1 month to < 4 years) treated with levetiracetam in the placebo-controlled study and were numerically more common than in patients treated with placebo. In this study, either levetiracetam or placebo was added to concurrent AED therapy. Levetiracetam (N=60) % Placebo (N=56) % Somnolence 13 2 Irritability 12 0 In the 7-day controlled pediatric clinical study in patients 1 month to < 4 years of age, 3% of patients receiving levetiracetam and 2% receiving placebo either discontinued or had a dose reduction as a result of an adverse reaction. There was no adverse reaction that resulted in discontinuation for more than one patient. Myoclonic Seizures Although the pattern of adverse reactions in this study seems somewhat different from that seen in patients with partial-onset seizures, this is likely due to the much smaller number of patients in this study compared to partial seizure studies. The adverse reaction pattern for patients with JME is expected to be essentially the same as for patients with partial seizures. In the controlled clinical study in patients 12 years of age and older with myoclonic seizures, [see CLINICAL STUDIES ( 14.2 )], the most common adverse reactions in patients receiving levetiracetam in combination with other AEDs, for events with rates greater than placebo, were somnolence, neck pain, and pharyngitis. Table 7 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 5% of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy patients experiencing myoclonic seizures treated with levetiracetam and were numerically more common than in patients treated with placebo. In this study, either levetiracetam or placebo was added to concurrent AED therapy. Levetiracetam (N=60) % Placebo (N=60) % Somnolence 12 2 Neck Pain 8 2 Pharyngitis 7 0 Depression 5 2 Influenza 5 2 Vertigo 5 3 In the placebo-controlled study, 8% of patients receiving levetiracetam and 2% receiving placebo either discontinued or had a dose reduction as a result of an adverse reaction. The adverse reactions that led to discontinuation or dose reduction and that occurred more frequently in levetiracetam-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients are presented in Table 8. Adverse Reaction Levetiracetam (N=60) % Placebo (N=60) % Anxiety 3 2 Depressed mood 2 0 Depression 2 0 Diplopia 2 0 Hypersomnia 2 0 Insomnia 2 0 Irritability 2 0 Nervousness 2 0 Somnolence 2 0 Primary Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures Although the pattern of adverse reactions in this study seems somewhat different from that seen in patients with partial-onset seizures, this is likely due to the much smaller number of patients in this study compared to partial seizure studies. The adverse reaction pattern for patients with primary generalized tonic-clonic (PGTC) seizures is expected to be essentially the same as for patients with partial seizures. In the controlled clinical study that included patients 4 years of age and older with PGTC seizures, [see CLINICAL STUDIES ( 14.3 )], the most common adverse reaction in patients receiving levetiracetam in combination with other AEDs, for events with rates greater than placebo, was nasopharyngitis. Table 9 lists adverse reactions that occurred in at least 5% of idiopathic generalized epilepsy patients experiencing PGTC seizures treated with levetiracetam and were numerically more common than in patients treated with placebo. In this study, either levetiracetam or placebo was added to concurrent AED therapy. Levetiracetam (N=79) % Placebo (N=84) % Nasopharyngitis 14 5 Fatigue 10 8 Diarrhea 8 7 Irritability 6 2 Mood swings 5 1 In the placebo-controlled study, 5% of patients receiving levetiracetam and 8% receiving placebo either discontinued or had a dose reduction during the treatment period as a result of an adverse reaction. This study was too small to adequately characterize the adverse reactions that could be expected to result in discontinuation of treatment in this population. It is expected that the adverse reactions that would lead to discontinuation in this population would be similar to those resulting in discontinuation in other epilepsy trials (see Tables 4 and 8). In addition, the following adverse reactions were seen in other controlled adult studies of levetiracetam: balance disorder, disturbance in attention, eczema, memory impairment, myalgia, and blurred vision. Comparison of Gender, Age and Race The overall adverse reaction profile of levetiracetam was similar between females and males. There are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse reactions by age and race. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of levetiracetam. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been reported in patients receiving marketed levetiracetam worldwide. The listing is alphabetized: abnormal liver function test, acute kidney injury, anaphylaxis, angioedema, agranulocytosis, choreoathetosis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), dyskinesia, erythema multiforme, hepatic failure, hepatitis, hyponatremia, muscular weakness, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), pancreatitis, pancytopenia (with bone marrow suppression identified in some of these cases), panic attack, thrombocytopenia, weight loss and worsening of seizures including in patients with SCN8A mutations. Alopecia has been reported with levetiracetam use; recovery was observed in majority of cases where levetiracetam was discontinued."

    "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Use the oral solution for pediatric patients with body weight \u2264 20 kg ( 2.1 ). For pediatric patients, use weight-based dosing for the oral solution with a calibrated measuring device (not a household teaspoon or tablespoon) ( 2.1 ) Partial Onset Seizures (monotherapy or adjunctive therapy) 1 Month to < 6 Months: 7 mg/kg twice daily; increase by 7 mg/kg twice daily every 2 weeks to recommended dose of 21 mg/kg twice daily ( 2.2 ) 6 Months to < 4 Years: 10 mg/kg twice daily; increase by 10 mg/kg twice daily every 2 weeks to recommended dose of 25 mg/kg twice daily ( 2.2 ) 4 Years to < 16 Years: 10 mg/kg twice daily; increase by 10 mg/kg twice daily every 2 weeks to recommended dose of 30 mg/kg twice daily ( 2.2 ) Adults 16 Years and Older: 500 mg twice daily; increase by 500 mg twice daily every 2 weeks to a recommended dose of 1500 mg twice daily ( 2.2 ) Myoclonic Seizures in Adults and Pediatric Patients 12 Years and Older 500 mg twice daily; increase by 500 mg twice daily every 2 weeks to recommended dose of 1500 mg twice daily ( 2.3 ) Primary Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures 6 Years to < 16 Years: 10 mg/kg twice daily, increase in increments of 10 mg/kg twice daily every 2 weeks to recommended dose of 30 mg/kg twice daily ( 2.4 ) Adults 16 Years and Older: 500 mg twice daily, increase by 500 mg twice daily every 2 weeks to recommended dose of 1500 mg twice daily ( 2.4 ) Adult Patients with Impaired Renal Function Dose adjustment is recommended, based on the patient's estimated creatinine clearance ( 2.5 , 8.6 ) 2.1 Important Administration Instructions Levetiracetam tablets USP are given orally with or without food. The levetiracetam dosing regimen depends on the indication, age group, dosage form (tablets), and renal function. Prescribe the oral solution for pediatric patients with body weight \u2264 20 kg. Prescribe the oral solution or tablets for pediatric patients with body weight above 20 kg. When using the oral solution in pediatric patients, dosing is weight-based (mg per kg) using a calibrated measuring device (not a household teaspoon or tablespoon). Levetiracetam tablets should be swallowed whole. Levetiracetam tablets should not be chewed or crushed. 2.2 Dosing for Partial Onset Seizures The recommended dosing for monotherapy and adjunctive therapy is the same; as outlined below. Adults 16 Years of Age and Older Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 1000 mg/day, given as twice-daily dosing (500 mg twice daily). Additional dosing increments may be given (1000 mg/day additional every 2 weeks) to a maximum recommended daily dose of 3000 mg. There is no evidence that doses greater than 3000 mg/day confer additional benefit. Pediatric Patients 1 Month to < 6 Months: Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 14 mg/kg in 2 divided doses (7 mg/kg twice daily). Increase the daily dose every 2 weeks by increments of 14 mg/kg to the recommended daily dose of 42 mg/kg (21 mg/kg twice daily). In the clinical trial, the mean daily dose was 35 mg/kg in this age group. 6 Months to <4 Years: Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 20 mg/kg in 2 divided doses (10 mg/kg twice daily). Increase the daily dose in 2 weeks by an increment of 20 mg/kg to the recommended daily dose of 50 mg/kg (25 mg/kg twice daily). If a patient cannot tolerate a daily dose of 50 mg/kg, the daily dose may be reduced. In the clinical trial, the mean daily dose was 47 mg/kg in this age group. 4 Years to < 16 Years: Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 20 mg/kg in 2 divided doses (10 mg/kg twice daily). Increase the daily dose every 2 weeks by increments of 20 mg/kg to the recommended daily dose of 60 mg/kg (30 mg/kg twice daily). If a patient cannot tolerate a daily dose of 60 mg/kg, the daily dose may be reduced. In the clinical trial, the mean daily dose was 44 mg/kg. The maximum daily dose was 3000 mg/day. For levetiracetam tablet dosing in pediatric patients weighing 20 to 40 kg, initiate treatment with a daily dose of 500 mg given as twice daily dosing (250 mg twice daily). Increase the daily dose every 2 weeks by increments of 500 mg to a maximum recommended daily dose of 1500 mg (750 mg twice daily). For levetiracetam tablet dosing in pediatric patients weighing more than 40 kg, initiate treatment with a daily dose of 1000 mg/day given as twice daily dosing (500 mg twice daily). Increase the daily dose every 2 weeks by increments of 1000 mg/day to a maximum recommended daily dose of 3000 mg (1500 mg twice daily). Levetiracetam Oral Solution Weight-Based Dosing Calculation For Pediatric Patients The following calculation should be used to determine the appropriate daily dose of oral solution for pediatric patients: 2.3 Dosing for Myoclonic Seizures in Patients 12 Years of Age and Older with Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy Initiate treatment with a dose of 1000 mg/day, given as twice-daily dosing (500 mg twice daily). Increase the dosage by 1000 mg/day every 2 weeks to the recommended daily dose of 3000 mg. The effectiveness of doses lower than 3000 mg/day has not been studied. 2.4 Dosing for Primary Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures Adults 16 Years of Age and Older Initiate treatment with a dose of 1000 mg/day, given as twice-daily dosing (500 mg twice daily). Increase dosage by 1000 mg/day every 2 weeks to the recommended daily dose of 3000 mg. The effectiveness of doses lower than 3000 mg/day has not been adequately studied. Pediatric Patients 6 to <16 Years of Age Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 20 mg/kg in 2 divided doses (10 mg/kg twice daily). Increase the daily dose every 2 weeks by increments of 20 mg/kg to the recommended daily dose of 60 mg/kg (30 mg/kg twice daily). The effectiveness of doses lower than 60 mg/kg/day has not been adequately studied. Patients with body weight \u226420 kg should be dosed with oral solution. Patients with body weight above 20 kg can be dosed with either tablets or oral solution [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2.1 )] . Only whole tablets should be administered. 2.5 Dosage Adjustments in Adult Patients with Renal Impairment Levetiracetam tablets dosing must be individualized according to the patient's renal function status. Recommended dosage adjustments for adults are shown in Table 1. In order to calculate the dose recommended for patients with renal impairment, creatinine clearance adjusted for body surface area must be calculated. To do this an estimate of the patient's creatinine clearance (CLcr) in mL/min must first be calculated using the following formula: Group Creatinine Clearance (mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) Dosage (mg) Frequency Normal >80 500 to 1,500 Every 12 hours Mild 50 to 80 500 to 1,000 Every 12 hours Moderate 30 to 50 250 to 750 Every 12 hours Severe <30 250 to 500 Every 12 hours ESRD patients using dialysis ----- 500 to 1,000 Following dialysis, a 250 to 500 mg supplemental dose is recommended. Every 24 hours 2.6 Discontinuation of Levetiracetam tablets Avoid abrupt withdrawal from Levetiracetam Tablets in order to reduce the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.8 )] figure 1 figure 2"
