    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Since entecavir is primarily eliminated by the kidneys [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] , co-administration of entecavir with drugs that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase serum concentrations of either entecavir or the co-administered drug. Co-administration of entecavir with lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil, or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate did not result in significant drug interactions. The effects of co-administration of entecavir with other drugs that are renally eliminated or are known to affect renal function have not been evaluated, and patients should be monitored closely for adverse events when entecavir is co-administered with such drugs."

    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in other sections of the labeling: Exacerbations of hepatitis after discontinuation of treatment [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . In adults, the most common adverse reactions (\u22653%, all severity grades) are headache, fatigue, dizziness, and nausea. The adverse reactions observed in pediatric patients were consistent with those observed in adults. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Amneal Pharmaceuticals at 1-877-835-5472 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Clinical Trial Experience in Adults Compensated Liver Disease Assessment of adverse reactions is based on four studies (AI463014, AI463022, AI463026, and AI463027) in which 1,720 subjects with chronic hepatitis B virus infection and compensated liver disease received double-blind treatment with entecavir 0.5 mg/day (n=679), entecavir 1 mg/day (n=183), or lamivudine (n=858) for up to 2 years. Median duration of therapy was 69 weeks for entecavir-treated subjects and 63 weeks for lamivudine-treated subjects in Studies AI463022 and AI463027 and 73 weeks for entecavir-treated subjects and 51 weeks for lamivudine-treated subjects in Studies AI463026 and AI463014. The safety profiles of entecavir and lamivudine were comparable in these studies. The most common adverse reactions of any severity (\u22653%) with at least a possible relation to study drug for entecavir-treated subjects were headache, fatigue, dizziness, and nausea. The most common adverse reactions among lamivudine-treated subjects were headache, fatigue, and dizziness. One percent of entecavir-treated subjects in these four studies compared with 4% of lamivudine-treated subjects discontinued for adverse events or abnormal laboratory test results. Clinical adverse reactions of moderate-severe intensity and considered at least possibly related to treatment occurring during therapy in four clinical studies in which entecavir was compared with lamivudine are presented in Table 3.

ULN=upper limit of normal. Among entecavir-treated subjects in these studies, on-treatment ALT elevations greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) and greater than 2 times baseline generally resolved with continued treatment. A majority of these exacerbations were associated with a \u22652 log 10 /mL reduction in viral load that preceded or coincided with the ALT elevation. Periodic monitoring of hepatic function is recommended during treatment. Exacerbations of Hepatitis After Discontinuation of Treatment An exacerbation of hepatitis or ALT flare was defined as ALT greater than 10 times ULN and greater than 2 times the subject\u2019s reference level (minimum of the baseline or last measurement at end of dosing). For all subjects who discontinued treatment (regardless of reason), Table 5 presents the proportion of subjects in each study who experienced post-treatment ALT flares. In these studies, a subset of subjects was allowed to discontinue treatment at or after 52 weeks if they achieved a protocol-defined response to therapy. If entecavir is discontinued without regard to treatment response, the rate of post-treatment flares could be higher [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Table 5: Exacerbations of Hepatitis During Off-Treatment Follow-up, Subjects in Studies AI463022, AI463027, and AI463026 Subjects with ALT Elevations >10 x ULN and >2 x Reference a Entecavir Lamivudine Nucleoside-inhibitor-na\u00efve HBeAg-positive 4/174 (2%) 13/147 (9%) HBeAg-negative 24/302 (8%) 30/270 (11%) Lamivudine-refractory 6/52 (12%) 0/16 a Reference is the minimum of the baseline or last measurement at end of dosing. Median time to off-treatment exacerbation was 23 weeks for entecavir-treated subjects and 10 weeks for lamivudine-treated subjects. Decompensated Liver Disease Study AI463048 was a randomized, open-label study of entecavir 1 mg once daily versus adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg once daily given for up to 48 weeks in adult subjects with chronic HBV infection and evidence of hepatic decompensation, defined as a Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score of 7 or higher [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Among the 102 subjects receiving entecavir, the most common treatment-emergent adverse events of any severity, regardless of causality, occurring through Week 48 were peripheral edema (16%), ascites (15%), pyrexia (14%), hepatic encephalopathy (10%), and upper respiratory infection (10%). Clinical adverse reactions not listed in Table 3 that were observed through Week 48 include blood bicarbonate decreased (2%) and renal failure (<1%). Eighteen of 102 (18%) subjects treated with entecavir, and 18/89 (20%) subjects treated with adefovir dipivoxil died during the first 48 weeks of therapy. The majority of deaths (11 in the entecavir group and 16 in the adefovir dipivoxil group) were due to liver-related causes such as hepatic failure, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, and upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The rate of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) through Week 48 was 6% (6/102) for subjects treated with entecavir and 8% (7/89) for subjects treated with adefovir dipivoxil. Five percent of subjects in either treatment arm discontinued therapy due to an adverse event through Week 48. No subject in either treatment arm experienced an on-treatment hepatic flare (ALT >2 x baseline and >10 x ULN) through Week 48. Eleven of 102 (11%) subjects treated with entecavir and 11/89 (13%) subjects treated with adefovir dipivoxil had a confirmed increase in serum creatinine of 0.5 mg/dL through Week 48. HIV/HBV Co-infected The safety profile of entecavir 1 mg (n=51) in HIV/HBV co-infected subjects enrolled in Study AI463038 was similar to that of placebo (n=17) through 24 weeks of blinded treatment and similar to that seen in non-HIV infected subjects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Liver Transplant Recipients Among 65 subjects receiving entecavir in an open-label, post-liver transplant trial [see Use in Specific Populations (8.8) ] , the frequency and nature of adverse events were consistent with those expected in patients who have received a liver transplant and the known safety profile of entecavir. Clinical Trial Experience in Pediatric Subjects The safety of entecavir in pediatric subjects 2 to less than 18 years of age is based on two clinical trials in subjects with chronic HBV infection (one Phase 2 pharmacokinetic trial [AI463028] and one Phase 3 trial [AI463189]). These trials provided experience in 168 HBeAg-positive subjects treated with entecavir for a median duration of 72 weeks. The adverse reactions observed in pediatric subjects who received treatment with entecavir were consistent with those observed in clinical trials of entecavir in adults. Adverse drug reactions reported in greater than 1% of pediatric subjects included abdominal pain, rash events, poor palatability (\u201cproduct taste abnormal\u201d), nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Data from Long-Term Observational Study Study AI463080 was a randomized, global, observational, open-label Phase 4 study to assess long-\u00adterm risks and benefits of entecavir (0.5 mg/day or 1 mg/day) treatment as compared to other standard-of-care HBV nucleos(t)ide analogues in subjects with chronic HBV infection. A total of 12,378 patients were treated with entecavir (n=6,216) or other HBV nucleos(t)ide treatment [non-entecavir (ETV)] (n=6,162). Patients were evaluated at baseline and subsequently every 6 months for up to 10 years. The principal clinical outcome events assessed during the study were overall malignant neoplasms, liver-related HBV disease progression, HCC, non-HCC malignant neoplasms, and death. The study showed that entecavir was not significantly associated with an increased risk of malignant neoplasms compared to other standard-of-care HBV nucleos(t)ides, as assessed by either the composite endpoint of overall malignant neoplasms or the individual endpoint of non-HCC malignant neoplasms. The most commonly reported malignancy in both the entecavir and non-ETV groups was HCC followed by gastrointestinal malignancies. The data also showed that long-term entecavir use was not associated with a lower occurrence of HBV disease progression or a lower rate of death overall compared to other HBV nucleos(t)ides. The principal clinical outcome event assessments are shown in Table 6. Table 6: Principal Analyses of Time to Adjudicated Events - Randomized Treated Subjects Endpoint c Number of Subjects with Events Entecavir N=6,216 Non-ETV N=6,162 Hazard Ratio [Entecavir:Non-ETV] (CI a ) Primary Endpoints Overall malignant neoplasm 331 337 0.93 (0.800, 1.084) Liver-related HBV disease progression 350 375 0.89 (0.769, 1.030) Death 238 264 0.85 (0.713, 1.012) Secondary Endpoints Non-HCC malignant neoplasm 95 81 1.10 (0.817, 1.478) HCC 240b 263 0.87 (0.727, 1.032) Analyses were stratified by geographic region and prior HBV nucleos(t)ide experience. a 95.03% CI for overall malignant neoplasm, death, and liver-related HBV disease progression; 95% CI for non-HCC malignant neoplasm and HCC. b One subject had a pre-treatment HCC event and was excluded from the analysis. c Overall malignant neoplasm is a composite event of HCC or non-HCC malignant neoplasm. Liver-related HBV disease progression is a composite event of liver-related death, HCC, or non-HCC HBV disease progression. CI = confidence interval; N = total number of subjects. Limitations of the study included population changes over the long-term follow-up period and more frequent post-randomization treatment changes in the non-ETV group. In addition, the study was underpowered to demonstrate a difference in the non-HCC malignancy rate because of the lower than expected background rate. Adverse Reactions from Postmarketing Spontaneous Reports The following adverse reactions have been reported during postmarketing use of entecavir. Because these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to entecavir exposure. Immune system disorders: Anaphylactoid reaction. Metabolism and nutrition disorders: Lactic acidosis. Hepatobiliary disorders: Increased transaminases. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Alopecia, rash."
