    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Moderate CYP2C9 or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors: Consider alternative agents or monitor closely for adverse reactions. ( 7.1 ) Strong CYP3A4 inducers: Avoid concomitant use with BALVERSA. ( 7.1 ) Moderate CYP3A4 inducers: Administer BALVERSA at a dose of 9 mg. ( 7.1 ) Serum phosphate level-altering agents: Avoid concomitant use with agents that can alter serum phosphate levels before the initial dose modification period. ( 2.3 , 7.1 ) P-gp substrates: Separate BALVERSA administration by at least 6 hours before or after administration of P-gp substrates with narrow therapeutic indices. ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on BALVERSA Table 7 summarizes drug interactions that affect the exposure of BALVERSA or serum phosphate level and their clinical management. Table 7: Drug Interactions that Affect BALVERSA Moderate CYP2C9 or Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Clinical Impact Co-administration of BALVERSA with moderate CYP2C9 or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors increased erdafitinib plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Increased erdafitinib plasma concentrations may lead to increased drug-related toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5) ]. Clinical Management Consider alternative therapies that are not moderate CYP2C9 or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors during treatment with BALVERSA. If co-administration of a moderate CYP2C9 or strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is unavoidable, monitor closely for adverse reactions and consider dose modifications accordingly [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. If the moderate CYP2C9 or strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is discontinued, resume the BALVERSA dose before dose modifications in the absence of drug-related toxicity. Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Clinical Impact Co-administration of BALVERSA with strong CYP3A4 inducers decreased erdafitinib plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Decreased erdafitinib plasma concentrations may lead to decreased activity. Clinical Management Avoid co-administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers with BALVERSA. Moderate CYP3A4 Inducers Clinical Impact Co-administration of BALVERSA with moderate CYP3A4 inducers may decrease erdafitinib plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Decreased erdafitinib plasma concentrations may lead to decreased activity. Clinical Management If a moderate CYP3A4 inducer must be co-administered at the start of BALVERSA treatment, administer BALVERSA at a dose of 9 mg daily. When a moderate CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued, continue BALVERSA at the same dose, in the absence of drug-related toxicity. Serum Phosphate Level-Altering Agents Clinical Impact Co-administration of BALVERSA with other serum phosphate level-altering agents may increase or decrease serum phosphate levels [see Pharmacodynamics (12.2) ]. Changes in serum phosphate levels due to serum phosphate level-altering agents (other than erdafitinib) may interfere with serum phosphate levels needed for the determination of initial dose increased based on serum phosphate levels [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. Clinical Management Avoid co-administration of serum phosphate level-altering agents with BALVERSA before initial dose increase period based on serum phosphate levels (Days 14 to 21) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. 7.2 Effect of BALVERSA on Other Drugs Table 8 summarizes the effect of BALVERSA on other drugs and their clinical management. Table 8: BALVERSA Drug Interactions that Affect Other Drugs P-glycoprotein (P-gp) Substrates Clinical Impact Co-administration of BALVERSA with P-gp substrates may increase the plasma concentrations of P-gp substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Increased plasma concentrations of P-gp substrates may lead to increased toxicity of the P-gp substrates. Clinical Management If co-administration of BALVERSA with P-gp substrates is unavoidable, separate BALVERSA administration by at least 6 hours before or after administration of P-gp substrates with narrow therapeutic index."

    "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Confirm the presence of FGFR3 genetic alterations in tumor specimens prior to initiation of treatment with BALVERSA. ( 2.1 ) Recommended initial dosage: 8 mg orally once daily with a dose increase to 9 mg daily if criteria are met. ( 2.2 ) Swallow whole with or without food. ( 2.2 ) 2.1 Patient Selection Select patients for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma with BALVERSA based on the presence of susceptible FGFR3 genetic alterations in tumor specimens as detected by an FDA-approved companion diagnostic [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . Information on FDA-approved tests for the detection of FGFR3 genetic alterations in urothelial cancer is available at: http://www.fda.gov/CompanionDiagnostics. 2.2 Recommended Dosage and Schedule The recommended starting dose of BALVERSA is 8 mg (two 4 mg tablets) orally once daily, with a dose increase to 9 mg (three 3 mg tablets) once daily based on tolerability, including hyperphosphatemia, at 14 to 21 days [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. Swallow tablets whole with or without food. If vomiting occurs any time after taking BALVERSA, the next dose should be taken the next day. Treatment should continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. If a dose of BALVERSA is missed, it can be taken as soon as possible on the same day. Resume the regular daily dose schedule for BALVERSA the next day. Extra tablets should not be taken to make up for the missed dose. Dose Increase based on Serum Phosphate Levels Assess serum phosphate levels 14 to 21 days after initiating treatment. Increase the dose of BALVERSA to 9 mg once daily if serum phosphate level is < 9.0 mg/dL and there are no ocular disorders or Grade 2 or greater adverse reactions. If the phosphate level is 9.0 mg/dL or higher follow the relevant dose modifications in Table 2. Monitor phosphate levels monthly for hyperphosphatemia [see Pharmacodynamics (12.2) ] . 2.3 Dose Modifications for Adverse Reactions The recommended dose modifications for adverse reactions are listed in Table 1.

Table 2: Dose Modifications for Adverse Reactions Adverse Reaction BALVERSA Dose Modification Hyperphosphatemia In all patients, restrict phosphate intake to 600\u2013800 mg daily. <6.99 mg/dL Continue BALVERSA at current dose. 7\u20138.99 mg/dL Continue BALVERSA at current dose. Start phosphate binder with food until phosphate level is <7 mg/dL. Reduce the dose if serum phosphate remains \u22657 mg/dL for a period of 2 months or if clinically necessary. 9\u201310 mg/dL Withhold BALVERSA with weekly reassessments until level returns to <7 mg/dL. Then restart BALVERSA at the same dose level. Start phosphate binder with food until serum phosphate level returns to <7 mg/dL. Reduce the dose if serum phosphate remains \u22659 mg/dL for a period of 1 month or if clinically necessary. >10 mg/dL Withhold BALVERSA with weekly reassessments until level returns to <7 mg/dL. Then may restart BALVERSA at the first reduced dose level. If hyperphosphatemia (\u226510 mg/dL) for >2 weeks, discontinue BALVERSA permanently. Medical management of symptoms as clinically relevant. Serum phosphate with life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated (e.g., dialysis) Discontinue BALVERSA permanently. Central Serous Retinopathy (CSR) Any Withhold BALVERSA and perform an ophthalmic evaluation within 2 weeks: If improving within 14 days, restart BALVERSA at the current dose. If not improving within 14 days, withhold BALVERSA until improving; once improving, may resume at the next lower dose level. Upon restarting BALVERSA, monitor for recurrence every 1 to 2 weeks for a month. If recurs or has not improved after 4 weeks of withholding BALVERSA, consider permanent discontinuation. Other Adverse Reactions Dose adjustment graded using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAEv5.0). Grade 3 Withhold BALVERSA until resolves to Grade 1 or baseline, then may resume dose level lower. Grade 4 Permanently discontinue."
