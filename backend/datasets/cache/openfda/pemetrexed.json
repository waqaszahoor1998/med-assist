    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Ibuprofen increased risk of pemetrexed for injection toxicity in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Modify the ibuprofen dosage as recommended for patients with a creatinine clearance between 45 mL/min and 79 mL/min. ( 2.5 , 5.6 , 7 ) Effects of Ibuprofen on Pemetrexed Ibuprofen increases exposure (AUC) of pemetrexed [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . In patients with creatinine clearance between 45 mL/min and 79 mL/min: Avoid administration of ibuprofen for 2 days before, the day of, and 2 days following administration of pemetrexed for injection [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] . Monitor patients more frequently for myelosuppression, renal, and gastrointestinal toxicity, if concomitant administration of ibuprofen cannot be avoided."

In clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions (incidence \u226520%) of pemetrexed for injection, when administered as a single agent, are fatigue, nausea, and anorexia. The most common adverse reactions (incidence \u226520%) of pemetrexed for injection, when administered in combination with cisplatin are vomiting, neutropenia, anemia, stomatitis/pharyngitis, thrombocytopenia, and constipation. The most common adverse reactions (incidence \u226520%) of pemetrexed for injection, when administered in combination with pembrolizumab and platinum chemotherapy, are fatigue/asthenia, nausea, constipation, diarrhea, decreased appetite, rash, vomiting, cough, dyspnea, and pyrexia. Non-Squamous NSCLC First-line Treatment of Metastatic Non-squamous NSCLC with Pembrolizumab and Platinum Chemotherapy The safety of pemetrexed for injection, in combination with pembrolizumab and investigator's choice of platinum (either carboplatin or cisplatin), was investigated in Study KEYNOTE-189, a multicenter, double-blind, randomized (2:1), active-controlled trial in patients with previously untreated, metastatic non-squamous NSCLC with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. A total of 607 patients received pemetrexed for injection, pembrolizumab, and platinum every 3 weeks for 4 cycles followed by pemetrexed for injection and pembrolizumab (n=405), or placebo, pemetrexed for injection, and platinum every 3 weeks for 4 cycles followed by placebo and pemetrexed for injection (n=202). Patients with autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within 2 years of treatment; a medical condition that required immunosuppression; or who had received more than 30 Gy of thoracic radiation within the prior 26 weeks were ineligible [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . The median duration of exposure to pemetrexed for injection was 7.2 months (range: 1 day to 1.7 years). Seventy-two percent of patients received carboplatin. The study population characteristics were: median age of 64 years (range: 34 to 84), 49% age 65 years or older, 59% male, 94% White and 3% Asian, and 18% with history of brain metastases at baseline. Pemetrexed for Injection was discontinued for adverse reactions in 23% of patients in the pemetrexed for injection, pembrolizumab, and platinum arm. The most common adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of pemetrexed for injection in this arm were acute kidney injury (3%) and pneumonitis (2%). Adverse reactions leading to interruption of pemetrexed for injection occurred in 49% of patients in the pemetrexed for injection, pembrolizumab, and platinum arm. The most common adverse reactions or laboratory abnormalities leading to interruption of pemetrexed for injection in this arm (\u22652%) were neutropenia (12%), anemia (7%), asthenia (4%), pneumonia (4%), thrombocytopenia (4%), increased blood creatinine (3%), diarrhea (3%), and fatigue (3%). Table 2 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred in \u226520% of patients treated with pemetrexed for injection, pembrolizumab, and platinum.

Patients received either pemetrexed for injection 500 mg/m 2 intravenously and cisplatin 75 mg/m 2 intravenously on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle (n=839) or gemcitabine 1250 mg/m 2 intravenously on Days 1 and 8 and cisplatin 75 mg/m 2 intravenously on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle (n=830). All patients were fully supplemented with folic acid and vitamin B 12 . Study JMDB excluded patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS of 2 or greater), uncontrolled third-space fluid retention, inadequate bone marrow reserve and organ function, or a calculated creatinine clearance less than 45 mL/min. Patients unable to stop using aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or unable to take folic acid, vitamin B 12 or corticosteroids were also excluded from the study. The data described below reflect exposure to pemetrexed for injection plus cisplatin in 839 patients in Study JMDB. Median age was 61 years (range 26-83 years); 70% of patients were men; 78% were White, 16% were Asian, 2.9% were Hispanic or Latino, 2.1% were Black or African American, and <1% were other ethnicities; 36% had an ECOG PS 0. Patients received a median of 5 cycles of pemetrexed for injection. Table 4 provides the frequency and severity of adverse reactions that occurred in \u22655% of 839 patients receiving pemetrexed for injection in combination with cisplatin in Study JMDB. Study JMDB was not designed to demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in adverse reaction rates for pemetrexed for injection, as compared to the control arm, for any specified adverse reaction listed in Table 4 .

Patients received either pemetrexed for injection 500 mg/m 2 or matching placebo intravenously every 21 days until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients in both study arms were fully supplemented with folic acid and vitamin B 12 . Study JMEN excluded patients with an ECOG PS of 2 or greater, uncontrolled third-space fluid retention, inadequate bone marrow reserve and organ function, or a calculated creatinine clearance less than 45 mL/min. Patients unable to stop using aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or unable to take folic acid, vitamin B 12 or corticosteroids were also excluded from the study. The data described below reflect exposure to pemetrexed for injection in 438 patients in Study JMEN. Median age was 61 years (range 26-83 years), 73% of patients were men; 65% were White, 31% were Asian, 2.9% were Hispanic or Latino, and <2% were other ethnicities; 39% had an ECOG PS 0. Patients received a median of 5 cycles of pemetrexed for injection and a relative dose intensity of pemetrexed for injection of 96%. Approximately half the patients (48%) completed at least six, 21-day cycles and 23% completed ten or more 21-day cycles of pemetrexed for injection.

Patients were randomized to receive pemetrexed for injection 500 mg/m 2 or matching placebo intravenously on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients in both study arms received folic acid and vitamin B 12 supplementation. PARAMOUNT excluded patients with an ECOG PS of 2 or greater, uncontrolled third-space fluid retention, inadequate bone marrow reserve and organ function, or a calculated creatinine clearance less than 45 mL/min. Patients unable to stop using aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or unable to take folic acid, vitamin B 12 or corticosteroids were also excluded from the study. The data described below reflect exposure to pemetrexed for injection in 333 patients in PARAMOUNT. Median age was 61 years (range 32 to 83 years); 58% of patients were men; 94% were White, 4.8% were Asian, and <1% were Black or African American; 36% had an ECOG PS 0. The median number of maintenance cycles was 4 for pemetrexed for injection and placebo arms. Dose reductions for adverse reactions occurred in 3.3% of patients in the pemetrexed for injection arm and 0.6% in the placebo arm. Dose delays for adverse reactions occurred in 22% of patients in the pemetrexed for injection arm and 16% in the placebo arm.

Patients received pemetrexed for injection 500 mg/m 2 intravenously in combination with cisplatin 75 mg/m 2 intravenously on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle or cisplatin 75 mg/m 2 intravenously on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle administered until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Safety was assessed in 226 patients who received at least one dose of pemetrexed for injection in combination with cisplatin and 222 patients who received at least one dose of cisplatin alone. Among 226 patients who received pemetrexed for injection in combination with cisplatin, 74% (n=168) received full supplementation with folic acid and vitamin B 12 during study therapy, 14% (n=32) were never supplemented, and 12% (n=26) were partially supplemented. Study JMCH excluded patients with Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) of less than 70, inadequate bone marrow reserve and organ function, or a calculated creatinine clearance less than 45 mL/min. Patients unable to stop using aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were also excluded from the study. The data described below reflect exposure to pemetrexed for injection in 168 patients that were fully supplemented with folic acid and vitamin B 12 . Median age was 60 years (range 19 to 85 years); 82% were men; 92% were White, 5% were Hispanic or Latino, 3.0% were Asian, and <1% were other ethnicities; 54% had KPS of 90-100. The median number of treatment cycles administered was 6 in the pemetrexed for injection/cisplatin fully supplemented group and 2 in the pemetrexed for injection/cisplatin never supplemented group. Patients receiving pemetrexed for injection in the fully supplemented group had a relative dose intensity of 93% of the protocol-specified pemetrexed for injection dose intensity. The most common adverse reaction resulting in dose delay was neutropenia. Table 8 provides the frequency and severity of adverse reactions \u22655% in the subgroup of pemetrexed for injection-treated patients who were fully vitamin supplemented in Study JMCH. Study JMCH was not designed to demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in adverse reaction rates for pemetrexed for injection, as compared to the control arm, for any specified adverse reaction listed in the table below.

The recommended dose of pemetrexed for injection for maintenance treatment of non-squamous NSCLC in patients with a creatinine clearance (calculated by Cockcroft-Gault equation) of 45 mL/min or greater is 500 mg/m 2 as an intravenous infusion over 10 minutes on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity after four cycles of platinum-based first-line chemotherapy. The recommended dose of pemetrexed for injection for treatment of recurrent non-squamous NSCLC in patients with a creatinine clearance (calculated by Cockcroft-Gault equation) of 45 mL/min or greater is 500 mg/m 2 as an intravenous infusion over 10 minutes on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 2.2 Recommended Dosage for Mesothelioma The recommended dose of pemetrexed for injection when administered with cisplatin in patients with a creatinine clearance (calculated by Cockcroft-Gault equation) of 45 mL/min or greater is 500 mg/m 2 as an intravenous infusion over 10 minutes on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 2.3 Renal Impairment Pemetrexed for Injection dosing recommendations are provided for patients with a creatinine clearance (calculated by Cockcroft-Gault equation) of 45 mL/min or greater [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 , 2.2 )] . There is no recommended dose for patients whose creatinine clearance is less than 45 mL/min [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 )] . 2.4 Premedication and Concomitant Medications to Mitigate Toxicity Vitamin Supplementation Initiate folic acid 400 mcg to 1000 mcg orally once daily, beginning 7 days before the first dose of pemetrexed for injection and continuing until 21 days after the last dose of pemetrexed for injection [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Administer vitamin B 12 , 1 mg intramuscularly, 1 week prior to the first dose of pemetrexed for injection and every 3 cycles thereafter. Subsequent vitamin B 12 injections may be given the same day as treatment with pemetrexed for injection [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Do not substitute oral vitamin B 12 for intramuscular vitamin B 12 . Corticosteroids Administer dexamethasone 4 mg orally twice daily for three consecutive days, beginning the day before each pemetrexed for injection administration. 2.5 Dosage Modification of Ibuprofen in Patients with Mild to Moderate Renal Impairment Receiving Pemetrexed for Injection In patients with creatinine clearances between 45 mL/min and 79 mL/min, modify administration of ibuprofen as follows [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 ), Drug Interactions ( 7 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] : Avoid administration of ibuprofen for 2 days before, the day of, and 2 days following administration of pemetrexed for injection. Monitor patients more frequently for myelosuppression, renal, and gastrointestinal toxicity, if concomitant administration of ibuprofen cannot be avoided. 2.6 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions Obtain complete blood count on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle. Assess creatinine clearance prior to each cycle. Do not administer pemetrexed for injection if the creatinine clearance is less than 45 mL/min. Delay initiation of the next cycle of pemetrexed for injection until: recovery of non-hematologic toxicity to Grade 0-2, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is 1500 cells/mm 3 or higher, and platelet count is 100,000 cells/mm 3 or higher. Upon recovery, modify the dosage of pemetrexed for injection in the next cycle as specified in Table 1 . For dosing modifications for cisplatin, carboplatin, or pembrolizumab, refer to their prescribing information. Table 1: Recommended Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions a a National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version 2 (NCI CTCAE v2). Toxicity in Most Recent Treatment Cycle Pemetrexed for Injection Dose Modification for Next Cycle Myelosuppressive toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] ANC less than 500/mm 3 and platelets greater than or equal to 50,000/mm 3 OR Platelet count less than 50,000/mm 3 without bleeding. 75% of previous dose Platelet count less than 50,000/mm 3 with bleeding 50% of previous dose Recurrent Grade 3 or 4 myelosuppression after 2 dose reductions Discontinue Non-hematologic toxicity Any Grade 3 or 4 toxicities EXCEPT mucositis or neurologic toxicity OR Diarrhea requiring hospitalization 75% of previous dose Grade 3 or 4 mucositis 50% of previous dose Renal toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Withhold until creatinine clearance is 45 mL/min or greater Grade 3 or 4 neurologic toxicity Permanently discontinue Recurrent Grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity after 2 dose reductions Permanently discontinue Severe and life-threatening Skin Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Permanently discontinue Interstitial Pneumonitis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Permanently discontinue 2.7 Preparation for Administration Pemetrexed for Injection is a hazardous drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures. 1 Calculate the dose of pemetrexed for injection and determine the number of vials needed. Reconstitute pemetrexed for injection to achieve a concentration of 25 mg/mL as follows: Reconstitute each 100-mg vial with 4.2 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (preservative-free) Reconstitute each 500-mg vial with 20 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (preservative-free) Do not use calcium-containing solutions for reconstitution. Gently swirl each vial until the powder is completely dissolved. The resulting solution is clear and ranges in color from colorless to yellow or green-yellow. FURTHER DILUTION IS REQUIRED prior to administration. Store reconstituted, preservative-free product under refrigerated conditions [2-8\u00b0C (36-46\u00b0F)] for no longer than 24 hours from the time of reconstitution. Discard vial after 24 hours. Inspect reconstituted product visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to further dilution. If particulate matter is observed, discard vial. Withdraw the calculated dose of pemetrexed for injection from the vial(s) and discard vial with any unused portion. Further dilute pemetrexed for injection with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection (preservative-free) to achieve a total volume of 100 mL for intravenous infusion. Store diluted, reconstituted product under refrigerated conditions [2-8\u00b0C (36-46\u00b0F)] for no more than 24 hours from the time of reconstitution. Discard after 24 hours."
