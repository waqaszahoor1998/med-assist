    "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong and Moderate CYP3A Inducers : Avoid concomitant use. ( 7.1 ) 7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on TABRECTA Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Coadministration of TABRECTA with a strong CYP3A inhibitor increased capmatinib exposure, which may increase the incidence and severity of adverse reactions of TABRECTA [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Closely monitor patients for adverse reactions during coadministration of TABRECTA with strong CYP3A inhibitors. Strong and Moderate CYP3A Inducers Coadministration of TABRECTA with a strong CYP3A inducer decreased capmatinib exposure. Coadministration of TABRECTA with a moderate CYP3A inducer may also decrease capmatinib exposure. Decreases in capmatinib exposure may decrease TABRECTA anti-tumor activity [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Avoid coadministration of TABRECTA with strong and moderate CYP3A inducers. 7.2 Effect of TABRECTA on Other Drugs CYP1A2 Substrates Coadministration of TABRECTA increased the exposure of a CYP1A2 substrate, which may increase the adverse reactions of these substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . If coadministration is unavoidable between TABRECTA and CYP1A2 substrates where minimal concentration changes may lead to serious adverse reactions, decrease the CYP1A2 substrate dosage in accordance with the approved prescribing information. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) Substrates Coadministration of TABRECTA increased the exposure of a P-gp substrate and a BCRP substrate, which may increase the adverse reactions of these substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . If coadministration is unavoidable between TABRECTA and P-gp or BCRP substrates where minimal concentration changes may lead to serious adverse reactions, decrease the P-gp or BCRP substrate dosage in accordance with the approved prescribing information. MATE1 and MATE2K Substrates Coadministration of TABRECTA may increase the exposure of MATE1 and MATE2K substrates, which may increase the adverse reactions of these substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . If coadministration is unavoidable between TABRECTA and MATE1 or MATE2K substrates where minimal concentration changes may lead to serious adverse reactions, decrease the MATE1 or MATE2K substrate dosage in accordance with the approved prescribing information."

    "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: ILD/Pneumonitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Pancreatic Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] The most common adverse reactions (\u2265 20%) are edema, nausea, musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, vomiting, dyspnea, cough, and decreased appetite. ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation at 1-888-669-6682 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer The safety of TABRECTA was evaluated in GEOMETRY mono-1 [see Clinical Studies (14)] . Patients received TABRECTA 400 mg orally twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (N = 373). Among patients who received TABRECTA, 37% were exposed for at least 6 months and 22% were exposed for at least one year. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 53% of patients who received TABRECTA. Serious adverse reactions in \u2265 2% of patients included dyspnea (7%), pneumonia (7%), pleural effusion (4.3%), musculoskeletal pain (3.8%), general physical health deterioration (2.9%), ILD/pneumonitis (2.7%), edema (2.4%), and vomiting (2.4%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 0.5% of patients who received TABRECTA, including pneumonitis (0.3%) and death, not otherwise specified (0.3%). Permanent discontinuation of TABRECTA due to an adverse reaction occurred in 17% of patients. The most frequent adverse reactions (\u2265 1%) leading to permanent discontinuation of TABRECTA were ILD/pneumonitis (2.4%), edema (2.4%), fatigue (1.3%), and pneumonia (1.1%). Dose interruptions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 57% of patients who received TABRECTA. Adverse reactions requiring dosage interruption in > 2% of patients who received TABRECTA included edema, increased blood creatinine, nausea, increased lipase, vomiting, increased ALT, dyspnea, pneumonia, fatigue, increased amylase, increased AST, musculoskeletal pain, abdominal pain, and increased blood bilirubin. Dose reductions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 26% of patients who received TABRECTA. Adverse reactions requiring dosage reductions in > 2% of patients who received TABRECTA included edema, increased ALT and increased blood creatinine. The most common adverse reactions (\u2265 20%) in patients who received TABRECTA were edema, nausea, musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, vomiting, dyspnea, cough, and decreased appetite. Table 3 summarizes the adverse reactions in GEOMETRY mono-1. Table 3: Adverse Reactions (\u2265 10%) in Patients Who Received TABRECTA in GEOMETRY mono-1 a Edema includes edema peripheral, generalized edema, face edema, edema, localized edema, edema genital, eyelid edema, peripheral swelling, scrotal edema, and penile edema. b Musculoskeletal pain includes arthralgia, back pain, bone pain, musculoskeletal chest pain, musculoskeletal pain, myalgia, neck pain, non-cardiac chest pain, pain in extremity, pain in jaw, spinal pain. c Fatigue includes fatigue and asthenia. d Pyrexia includes pyrexia and body temperature increased. e Cough includes cough, upper airway cough syndrome, and productive cough. f Pneumonia includes pneumonia aspiration, pneumonia, pneumonia influenzal, pneumonia bacterial, lower respiratory tract infection, and lung abscess. g Rash includes rash, dermatitis acneiform, rash maculo-papular, eczema, erythema multiforme, rash macular, dermatitis, rash erythematous, rash pustular, dermatitis bullous, and rash vesicular. h Dizziness includes dizziness, vertigo, and vertigo positional.
