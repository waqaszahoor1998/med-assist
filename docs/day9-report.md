# Day 9 Report: System Refinements and Advanced Features

**Date**: September 30, 2025  
**Focus**: Bug fixes, system refinements, and preparation for advanced features

## Overview

Day 9 focused on addressing critical bugs discovered during user testing and laying the groundwork for advanced feature implementation. The day began with resolving endpoint issues and system refinements to ensure optimal user experience.

## Critical Bug Fixes

### 1. Alternatives Endpoint URL Encoding Issue

#### Issue Identified
During user testing, the alternatives endpoint was failing for medicine names containing spaces:
```
Not Found: /api/alternatives/Metformin 500mg/
WARNING: Not Found: /api/alternatives/Metformin%20500mg/ HTTP/1.1" 404 30
```

#### Root Cause
The alternatives endpoint was not properly handling URL-encoded medicine names. When medicine names contained spaces, they were encoded as `%20` in URLs, but the endpoint was trying to match the encoded string directly against the database.

#### Resolution Implemented
**File**: `backend/api/views.py`  
**Function**: `get_alternatives()`

```python
# Before (causing 404 errors):
for med in medicines:
    if med.get('name', '').lower() == medicine_id.lower():
        medicine = med
        break

# After (working correctly):
from urllib.parse import unquote
decoded_name = unquote(medicine_id)
for med in medicines:
    if med.get('name', '').lower() == decoded_name.lower():
        medicine = med
        break
```

#### Test Results
**Input**: `GET /api/alternatives/Metformin/`
**Output**:
```json
{
    "status": "success",
    "original_medicine": "Metformin",
    "alternatives": [
        {
            "name": "Glipizide",
            "generic_name": "Glipizide",
            "indication": "Type 2 diabetes",
            "category": "Sulfonylurea",
            "reason": "Alternative diabetes medication"
        },
        {
            "name": "Sitagliptin",
            "generic_name": "Sitagliptin",
            "indication": "Type 2 diabetes",
            "category": "DPP-4 inhibitor",
            "reason": "Alternative diabetes medication"
