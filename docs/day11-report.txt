Day 11 Report - Medicine Assistant Project

Date: October 2, 2025
Project: Medicine Assistant - AI-Powered Prescription Analysis System

---

Executive Summary

Day 11 focused on migrating the system from in-memory storage to a persistent SQLite database and implementing user authentication. This transformed the project from a prototype to a production-ready application with secure multi-user support.

Primary Accomplishments

1. SQLite Database Migration
Objective: Replace temporary JSON file storage with persistent database

Technical Implementation:
- Created Django models for Medicine, UserProfile, MedicalKnowledge, MedicationReminder, PrescriptionHistory
- Generated and applied database migrations using Django ORM
- Migrated 18,802 medicine records and 29,974 medical knowledge entries
- Updated all API endpoints to use database queries instead of JSON file parsing

Results:
- Database size: 12.2 MB SQLite file
- Total records: 48,776+ across all tables
- Data persistence: Survives server restarts
- Query performance: <100ms average response time

2. User Authentication System
Objective: Implement secure multi-user support with JWT authentication

Technical Implementation:
- JWT-based authentication using rest_framework_simplejwt
- Access token lifetime: 60 minutes, Refresh token: 7 days
- User registration with email validation and password requirements
- Token rotation and blacklisting for security

API Endpoints Created:
- POST /api/auth/register/ - User registration
- POST /api/auth/login/ - User authentication
- POST /api/auth/refresh/ - Token refresh
- GET /api/auth/profile/ - User profile management
- POST /api/auth/logout/ - Secure logout

Results:
- Complete user data isolation
- Secure session management
- Multi-user support implemented

3. Test Organization
Objective: Organize scattered test files into professional structure

Implementation:
- Categorized 11 test files into Unit (4), Integration (5), End-to-End (2)
- Created comprehensive test documentation
- Implemented pytest configuration with markers
- Added test requirements and coverage reporting

4. Backend Optimization
Objective: Remove unused files and improve code organization

Results:
- Removed 5 unused files (~1,700 lines of code)
- Reduced file count from 35 to 30 files
- Moved optional scripts to separate directory
- Streamlined imports and dependencies

Current System Status

Fully Operational:
- SQLite database with 48,776+ records
- JWT authentication system
- 26 API endpoints
- Multi-user data isolation
- Professional test suite
