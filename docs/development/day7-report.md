# Day 7 Report: BioBERT System Enhancement

## Overview

Today focused on improving the BioBERT AI system that was integrated on Day 6. The goal was to enhance reliability, debugging capabilities, and testing coverage to ensure production readiness.

## Improvements Made

### Error Handling
- Separated tokenizer and model loading error handling
- Added specific error messages for different failure points
- Implemented granular error reporting with detailed logging

### Logging System
- Enhanced logging with step-by-step processing information
- Added debug-level logging for text preprocessing
- Implemented warning messages for edge cases
- Added stack trace logging for better error diagnosis

### Test Coverage
- Expanded test suite from 5 to 10 prescription scenarios
- Added test cases covering medical abbreviations and different formats
- Implemented statistical tracking for performance metrics
- Added comprehensive test result reporting

### Documentation
- Enhanced docstrings with detailed parameter descriptions
- Added return value specifications
- Improved inline comments for complex logic
- Better method descriptions for maintainability

## Test Results

### Performance Metrics
- Success Rate: 100% (10/10 test cases passed)
- Total Medicines Found: 15 across all tests
- Average Confidence Score: 0.78
- High Confidence Extractions: 12/15 (80%)

### New Test Cases Added
- "Prescribe: Omeprazole 20mg q.d. for acid reflux"
- "Patient needs: Warfarin 5mg b.i.d. for blood thinning"
- "Rx: Prednisone 10mg t.i.d. for inflammation"
- "Medication: Atorvastatin 40mg once daily at bedtime"
- "Give: Ciprofloxacin 500mg b.i.d. for UTI"
