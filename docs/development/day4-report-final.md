## Critical Bug Fixes

### Alternatives API Logic Resolution

**Issue**: The alternatives API was consistently returning "No alternatives found" for all medicine queries, despite having a comprehensive database of 9,198 medicines with alternative information.

**Root Cause Analysis**: Investigation revealed field name mismatches in the database matching logic. The code was searching for `categories` while the database contained `category`, and `indication` while the database used `indications`.

**Solution Implemented**: 
- Corrected field name matching to align with actual database schema
- Implemented a three-tier alternatives system:
  1. Direct alternatives from the medicine's alternatives field
  2. Category-based matching for similar therapeutic classes
  3. Indication-based matching for similar medical uses
- Added intelligent fallback alternatives for common medicine types

**Result**: The system now successfully returns relevant alternatives for medicines like Aspirin, Ibuprofen, and Metformin, with proper categorization and reasoning.

### Mock Pricing Data Removal

**User Request**: Remove unwanted pricing information from alternative medicine suggestions.

**Implementation**: Completely removed the `estimated_price` field from all alternative responses across the API endpoints.

**Impact**: Cleaner data presentation focused on medical information rather than commercial pricing.

### Frontend Scrollability Enhancement

**Issue**: The application interface was not scrollable, causing content to be cut off and creating a poor user experience.

**Technical Solution**:
- Wrapped the main content area in `SingleChildScrollView` for complete page scrollability
- Implemented fixed-height scrollable lists for medicine cards
- Removed problematic `Expanded` widgets that were causing layout constraints
- Added proper padding and spacing for optimal content display

**User Experience Impact**: Users can now access all content regardless of screen size or number of extracted medicines.

## Minor Issues Resolved

### Port Conflict Management

**Challenge**: Frequent "Port already in use" errors preventing server startup during development.

**Resolution**: Implemented proper process management to kill existing processes before starting new instances, ensuring clean server initialization.

### Flutter Compilation Optimization

**Issues Addressed**:
- WebView and icon compilation errors
- Unused import statements causing warnings
- Duplicate method definitions

**Solutions Applied**:
- Fixed `Icons.3d_rotation` to `Icons.view_in_ar` for proper icon rendering
- Simplified molecular viewer implementation
- Cleaned up unused imports and duplicate code
- Enhanced error handling with proper context checks

### API Response Validation

**Improvement**: Enhanced error handling and response validation across all API endpoints.

**Implementation**: Added comprehensive error checking, timeout handling, and user-friendly error messages.

## User Interface Improvements

### Form Validation Enhancement

**Implementation**: Upgraded from basic `TextField` to `TextFormField` with comprehensive validation:
- Real-time input validation
- Minimum length requirements
- Clear error messages
- Dynamic clear button functionality

### Loading State Optimization

**Enhancement**: Transformed basic loading indicators into informative user feedback cards with:
- Professional loading animations
- Contextual progress messages
- Time estimates for operations

### Error Message System

**New Feature**: Implemented a comprehensive error handling system with:
- Dismissible error cards
- Color-coded severity levels
- Actionable error messages
- Snackbar notifications for user feedback
